summary: This paper introduces contrastive alignment instructions (AlignInstruct) to address challenges in machine translation (MT) on large language models (LLMs) in unseen, low-resource languages. AlignInstruct emphasizes cross-lingual supervision via a cross-lingual discriminator built using statistical word alignments. The study fine-tuned BLOOMZ models (1b1, 3b, and 7b1) in up to 24 unseen languages, showing effectiveness of LLMs in translating unseen languages, consistent improvements in translatio...
