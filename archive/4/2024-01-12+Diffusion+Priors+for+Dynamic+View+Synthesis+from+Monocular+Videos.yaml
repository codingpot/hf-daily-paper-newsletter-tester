summary: This paper proposes a method for dynamic novel view synthesis from monocular videos using a diffusion prior that combines a 4D representation of both dynamic and static NeRF components. The authors finetune a pretrained RGB-D diffusion model using a customization technique, and then distill the knowledge to achieve geometric consistency with scene identity preservation. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, specifically in challenging cases, further advancing the ...
