summary: This paper presents TOFU, a benchmark for evaluating unlearning methods for large language models trained on sensitive data. It offers a dataset of synthetic author profiles and a suite of metrics to assess the effectiveness of unlearning algorithms. None of the baseline results show effective unlearning, motivating continued research in this area....
