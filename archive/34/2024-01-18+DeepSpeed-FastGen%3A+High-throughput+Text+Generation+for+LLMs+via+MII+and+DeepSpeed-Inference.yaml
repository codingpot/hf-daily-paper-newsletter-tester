summary: This paper introduces DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system that uses Dynamic SplitFuse for high-throughput and low-latency text generation for large language models. It leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference and supports non-persistent and persistent deployment options. Evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in throughput and latency across various models and hardware configurations....
