summary: The paper SceneVerse introduces the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse, and a unified pre-training framework, GPS, for grounded learning in 3D environments. Utilizing human annotations and a scalable scene-graph-based generation approach, SceneVerse encompasses 68K 3D indoor scenes and 2.5M vision-language pairs. Extensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of GPS in achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D visual grounding benchmarks and demonstrating its potenti...
