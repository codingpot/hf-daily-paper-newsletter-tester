summary: The TextureDreamer paper describes a novel method for image-guided texture synthesis that can transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across different categories using a personalized geometry-aware score distillation technique. The paper argues that texture creation is a significant challenge in vision and graphics and that existing classical and learning-based methods have limitations. The TextureDreamer method is capable of transferring highly deta...
