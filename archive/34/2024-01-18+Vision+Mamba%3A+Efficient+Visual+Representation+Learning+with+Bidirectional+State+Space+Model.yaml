summary: Vision Mamba is a new generic vision backbone that uses bidirectional Mamba blocks for efficient visual representation learning on long image sequences. It marks image sequences with position embeddings and uses bidirectional state space models to compress visual representation. It performs higher on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks and is computationally and memory efficient. It has the potential to become the next-generation backbone for vi...
