summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome limitations in high-quality video diffusion models by leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. The authors train models extended from Stable Diffusion and experiment with different training schemes to obtain a high-quality video model. They analyze the connection between spatial and temporal modules and observe that finetuning spatial modules with high-quality images results in a generic high-quality video model with better pictu...
