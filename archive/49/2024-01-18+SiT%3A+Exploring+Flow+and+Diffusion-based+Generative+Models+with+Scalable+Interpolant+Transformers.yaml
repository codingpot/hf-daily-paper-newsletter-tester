summary: The paper presents Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models that are built on the backbone of Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT allows for a flexible modular study of various design choices impacting generative models. It surpasses DiT uniformly across model sizes on the conditional ImageNet benchmark using the same architecture, parameters, and GFLOPs. The paper explores various diffusion coefficients to achieve an improved FID-50K score....
