summary: The paper proposes a method called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to enhance the reasoning capability and generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using an on-line reinforcement learning approach. This method employs the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to fine-tune the model and automatically sample reasoning paths given a question. ReFT significantly outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on GSM8K, MathQA, and SVAMP datasets and can be further improved by inferenc...
