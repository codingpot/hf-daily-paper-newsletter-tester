summary: The paper presents Incremental CONfidence (ICON), an optimization procedure for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) from 2D video frames without the need for accurate camera pose initialization. ICON estimates initial poses based on smooth camera motion and uses confidence as an adaptive measure to reweight gradients. It achieves better performance compared to methods that use Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pose in datasets like CO3D and HO3D....
