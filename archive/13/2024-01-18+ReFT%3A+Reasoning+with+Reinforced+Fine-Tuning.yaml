summary: ReFT proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning for enhancing reasoning capabilities
  of LLMs by employing reinforcement learning to further fine-tune the model. It significantly
  outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning and can be further improved by inference-time
  strategies. This approach obtains improvement by learning from the same training
  questions as SFT without relying on extra or augmented training questions, which
  indicates a superior generalization ability....
