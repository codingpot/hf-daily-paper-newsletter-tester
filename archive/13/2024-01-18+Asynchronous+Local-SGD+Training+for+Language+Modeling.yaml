summary: This paper examines the impact of worker hardware heterogeneity, model size,
  number of workers, and optimization techniques on asynchronous Local-SGD training
  for language models. Results show that naive implementations can take more iterations
  to converge, but a novel method using delayed Nesterov momentum updates and adjusting
  worker training steps based on computation speed matches the performance of synchronous
  Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step and significantly reduces wall
