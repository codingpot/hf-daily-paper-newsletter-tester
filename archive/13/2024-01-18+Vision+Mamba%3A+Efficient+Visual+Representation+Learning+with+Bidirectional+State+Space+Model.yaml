summary: This paper proposes a new vision backbone called Vision Mamba (Vim), which
  uses bidirectional state space models to learn efficient visual representations.
  Vim outperforms well-established vision transformers like DeiT while demonstrating
  significant computation and memory efficiency improvements. The results indicate
  that Vim has the potential to become the next-generation backbone for vision foundation
  models. The code is available at <https://github.com/hustvl/Vim>....
