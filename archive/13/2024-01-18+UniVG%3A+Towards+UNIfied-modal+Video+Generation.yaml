summary: "The paper proposes a Unified-modal Video Generation system that is capable\
  \ of handling multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities.\
  \ It revisits various video generation tasks within the system from the perspective\
  \ of generative freedom and classifies them into high-freedom and low-freedom categories.\
  \ The paper achieves the lowest Fr\xE9chet Video Distance (FVD) on the public academic\
  \ benchmark MSR-VTT and surpasses current open-source methods in human evaluations...."
