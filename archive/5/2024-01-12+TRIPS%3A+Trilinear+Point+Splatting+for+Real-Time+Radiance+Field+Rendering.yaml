summary: TRIPS stands for Trilinear Point Splatting, a new approach for real-time radiance field rendering. TRIPS combines Gaussian Splatting and ADOP, creating a technique that merges points into a screen-space image pyramid based on the point size. This technique improves rendering quality and maintains high frame rates, making it a better alternative than current state-of-the-art methods....
