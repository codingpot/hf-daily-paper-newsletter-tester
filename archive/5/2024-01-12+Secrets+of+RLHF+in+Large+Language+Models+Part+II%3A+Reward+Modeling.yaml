summary: This paper discusses the challenges of using reward models in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for language modeling and proposes solutions to address these issues. The authors introduce data-based and algorithmic approaches to improve the accuracy of reward models and their generalization ability. The paper also explores the application of meta-learning for iterative RLHF training to maintain the ability to differentiate between subtle differences in out-of-distribution samples...
