summary: This paper presents VideoCrafter2, a method for generating high-quality videos despite limited access to well-filtered, high-quality videos. The authors extend the training scheme of video models based on Stable Diffusion and investigate the feasibility of using low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images to obtain high-quality video models. They analyze the connection between spatial and temporal modules in video models and the distribution shift to low-quality videos. By finetuning ...
