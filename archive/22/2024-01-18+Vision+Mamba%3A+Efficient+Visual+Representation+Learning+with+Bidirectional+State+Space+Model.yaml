summary: This paper proposes Vim (Vision Mamba), a new generic vision backbone using bidirectional state space models for efficient visual representation learning. Vim outperforms well-established vision transformers like DeiT while being faster and using less GPU memory. Vim can overcome computation & memory constraints for high-resolution images and holds potential to become the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.
