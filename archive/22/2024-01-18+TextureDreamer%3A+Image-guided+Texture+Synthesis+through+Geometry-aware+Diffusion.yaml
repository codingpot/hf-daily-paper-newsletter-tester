summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that can transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories using personalized geometry-aware score distillation. It potentially democratizes texture creation by transferring highly detailed textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects with only a few casually captured images, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods....
