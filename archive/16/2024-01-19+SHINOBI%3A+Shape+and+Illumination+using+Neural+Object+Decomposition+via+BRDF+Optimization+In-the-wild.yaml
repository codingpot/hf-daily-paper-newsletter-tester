summary: The paper presents SHINOBI, an end-to-end framework for the reconstruction of object shape, material, and illumination from varying lighting, pose, and background images. This is achieved by using an implicit shape representation based on multi-resolution hash encoding, joint optimization of shape and camera alignment, and joint optimization of BRDF and illumination with object shape. SHINOBI is class-agnostic and produces relightable 3D assets suitable for various applications such as AR/VR, mo...
