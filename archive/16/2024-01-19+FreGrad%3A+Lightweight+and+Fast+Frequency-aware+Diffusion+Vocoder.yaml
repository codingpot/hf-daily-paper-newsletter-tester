summary: FreGrad is a lightweight and fast diffusion-based vocoder that generates realistic audio. It uses discrete wavelet transform to operate on a simple feature space, frequency-aware dilated convolution to elevate frequency awareness, and a bag of tricks to boost generation quality. FreGrad achieves faster training and inference times and reduces model size without sacrificing output quality. Audio samples are available at <https://mm.kaist.ac.kr/projects/FreGrad>....
