summary: This paper introduces a new method called SPARC for pre-training fine-grained multimodal representations from image-text pairs. The method uses sparse similarity metric between image patches and language tokens to group image patches for every token in the caption. It then computes a language-grouped vision embedding as the weighted average of patches. The token and language-grouped vision embeddings are contrasted through a fine-grained sequence-wise loss, which enables learning more detailed i...
