summary: 'VMamba is a new architecture that inherits components from ViTs while enhancing computational efficiency. It uses a state space model and a Cross-Scan Module to achieve linear complexity and global receptive fields, while also converting non-causal visual images into order patch sequences. Experimental results show promising visual perception task capabilities and advantages over existing benchmarks as image resolution increases.
