summary: The paper introduces DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system that uses Dynamic SplitFuse to provide efficient and high-throughput LLM serving, by balancing latency and throughput demands. It leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference for efficient and easy-to-use serving. The paper presents a detailed benchmarking methodology and evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in throughput and latency. The code is available for community contribution....
