summary: The paper proposes ICON, an optimization procedure for training NeRFs from 2D video frames without the requirement for pose initialization. ICON estimates initial guess for poses based on smooth camera motion and introduces 'confidence', an adaptive measure of model quality used to dynamically reweight gradients. ICON relies on high-confidence poses to learn NeRF and high-confidence 3D structure to learn poses, achieving superior performance compared to methods relying on SfM pose....
