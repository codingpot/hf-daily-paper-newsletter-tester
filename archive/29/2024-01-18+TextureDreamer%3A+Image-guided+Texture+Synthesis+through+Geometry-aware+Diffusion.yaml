summary: TextureDreamer is a new method for transferring relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across categories using image-guided texture synthesis. It uses personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD) and modifications to improve texture quality. Experiments on real images show that TextureDreamer produces highly realistic, semantic textures, surpassing the visual quality of previous state-of-the-art....
