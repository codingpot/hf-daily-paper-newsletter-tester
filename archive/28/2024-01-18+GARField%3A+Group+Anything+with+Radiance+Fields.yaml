summary: The paper presents Group Anything with Radiance Fields (GARField), an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field. The field can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings through automatic tree construction or user interaction, and is evaluated on a variety of in-the-wild scenes. GARField's hierarchical grouping could have applications in 3D asset extraction or dynamic sce...
