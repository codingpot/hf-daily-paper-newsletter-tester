summary: This paper presents VideoCrafter2, a method to overcome data limitations for high-quality video diffusion models. It explores the training scheme of video models extended from Stable Diffusion and investigates the feasibility of leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images to obtain a high-quality video model. The authors analyze the connection between the spatial and temporal modules of video models and the distribution shift to low-quality videos and observe that finetunin...
