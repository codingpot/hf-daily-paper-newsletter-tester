summary: ReFT is a method for fine-tuning large language models to enhance their reasoning capability. It addresses the limitation of supervised fine-tuning, which only relies on annotated reasoning paths for each question in the training data. Reinforced fine-tuning first warms up the model with supervised fine-tuning and then employs on-line reinforcement learning to further fine-tune the model with an abundance of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on different datasets show that ReFT significantl...
