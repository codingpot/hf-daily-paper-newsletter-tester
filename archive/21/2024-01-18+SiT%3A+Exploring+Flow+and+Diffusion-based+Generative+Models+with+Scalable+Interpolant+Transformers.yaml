summary: This paper introduces Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models built on the backbone of Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT explores different design choices for generative models based on dynamical transport and outperforms DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark with the same backbone, number of parameters, and GFLOPs. SiT's flexibility also allows for tuning various diffusion coefficients, resulting in an FID-50K score of 2.06....
