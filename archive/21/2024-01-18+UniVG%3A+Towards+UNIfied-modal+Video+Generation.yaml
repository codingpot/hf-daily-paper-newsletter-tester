summary: UniVG proposes a unified-modal video generation system that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. It classifies tasks into high- and low-freedom categories and uses Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to achieve the lowest FreÌ€chet Video Distance on the MSR-VTT benchmark. The method performs well in human evaluations and is on par with the current close-source method Gen2....
