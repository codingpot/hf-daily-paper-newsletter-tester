summary: This paper presents ICON (Incremental CONfidence), an optimization procedure for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) from 2D video frames without requiring accurate camera poses for each input view. ICON estimates initial poses using smooth camera motion and introduces confidence, an adaptive measure of model quality used to dynamically reweight gradients. ICON relies on high-confidence poses and 3D structure to learn NeRF, and achieves superior performance in 3D reconstruction compared to me...
