summary: TextureDreamer is a new method for image-guided texture synthesis that can transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across various categories. The core idea, personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD), improvements on recent advances in diffuse models, substantially improves the texture quality. Experiments show that TextureDreamer can successfully transfer highly realistic, semantically meaningful textures to arbitrary objects, surpassing ...
