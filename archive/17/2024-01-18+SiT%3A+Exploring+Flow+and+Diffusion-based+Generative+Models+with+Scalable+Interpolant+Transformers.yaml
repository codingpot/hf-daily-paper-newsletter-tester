summary: SiT (Scalable Interpolant Transformers) is a generative model that improves
  upon the Diffusion Transformers (DiT) model by exploring flow and diffusion-based
  models through a modular study of design choices. This includes using discrete vs.
  continuous time learning, choosing an objective function, deciding on the interpolant,
  and using a deterministic or stochastic sampler. By carefully introducing these
  ingredients, SiT surpasses DiT on a conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark with
  similar back...
