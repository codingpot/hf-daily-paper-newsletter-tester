summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that can
  transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images (3 to 5) to target
  3D shapes across arbitrary categories. It is able to create highly detailed and
  intricate textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects, potentially
  democratizing texture creation. The core idea, Personalized Geometry-aware Score
  Distillation, draws inspiration from recent advancements in diffusion models and
  substantially impr...
