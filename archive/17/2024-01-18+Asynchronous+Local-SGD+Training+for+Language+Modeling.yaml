summary: This paper studies asynchronous Local-SGD, a distributed optimization approach
  for language modeling, and finds that it takes more iterations to converge than
  synchronous Local-SGD. The authors propose a novel method using delayed Nesterov
  momentum update and adjusting workers' local training steps based on computation
  speed, which improves performance in terms of wall clock time and matches synchronous
  Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step....
