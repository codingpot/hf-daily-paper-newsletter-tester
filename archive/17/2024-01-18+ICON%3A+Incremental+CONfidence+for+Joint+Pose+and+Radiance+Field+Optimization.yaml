summary: This paper proposes the Incremental CONfidence (ICON) optimization technique
  for training NeRF models from 2D video frames without the need for initial camera
  poses. ICON estimates initial poses based on smooth camera motion and uses a confidence-based
  approach to dynamically weight gradients, alternating between optimizing the NeRF
  and camera poses. ICON outperforms methods that rely on initial poses from Structure-from-Motion
  pipelines on the CO3D and HO3D datasets....
