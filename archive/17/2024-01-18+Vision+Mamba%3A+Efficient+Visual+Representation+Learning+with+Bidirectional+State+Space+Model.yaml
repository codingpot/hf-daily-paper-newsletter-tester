summary: The paper proposes a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba
  blocks (Vim) for efficient and generic visual representation learning. Vim overcomes
  the computation and memory constraints for high-resolution images and outperforms
  well-established vision transformers on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection,
  and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks. Code is available at <https://github.com/hustvl/Vim>....
