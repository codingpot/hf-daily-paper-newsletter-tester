summary: This paper proposes a method called SceneVerse for scaling 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments to address challenges such as the complexity of 3D scenes, scarcity of paired 3D vision-language data, and the need for a unified learning framework. SceneVerse is a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset with 68K 3D indoor scenes and 2.5M vision-language pairs. The paper introduces a pre-training framework called GPS for 3D vision-language learning, which achieves state-of-the-art per...
