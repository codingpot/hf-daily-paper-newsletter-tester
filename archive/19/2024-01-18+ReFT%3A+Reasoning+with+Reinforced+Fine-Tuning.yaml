summary: ReFT is a fine-tuning approach that uses reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning capability of large language models, improving generalizability by learning from multiple reasoning paths rather than relying solely on annotated paths. Experiments on various datasets show that ReFT outperforms supervised fine-tuning and can be further improved with inference-time strategies, demonstrating superior generalization ability without relying on augmented training data....
