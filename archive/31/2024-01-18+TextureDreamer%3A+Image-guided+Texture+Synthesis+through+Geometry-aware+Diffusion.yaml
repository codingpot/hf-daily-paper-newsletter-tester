summary: TextureDreamer is a novel method for image-guided texture synthesis that can transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories. The method, called personalized geometry-aware score distillation, uses personalized modeling to extract texture information, variational score distillation for detailed appearance synthesis, and explicit geometry guidance with ControlNet. Experiments show that TextureDreamer surpasses the visual quality of...
