summary: This paper examines asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models and finds that it takes more iterations to converge than synchronous Local-SGD. A novel method that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts workers' local training steps based on their computation speed is proposed, which matches the perplexity per update step of synchronous Local-SGD and performs better in terms of wall clock time....
