summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome data limitations for high-quality text-to-video generation models. It investigates the feasibility of leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images for training, and analyzes the connection between spatial and temporal modules of video models. The proposed method results in a generic high-quality video model with improved picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
