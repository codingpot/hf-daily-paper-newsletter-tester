summary: The paper introduces Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models that improves upon Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT allows for a modular study of design choices that impact generative models, including using discrete or continuous time learning, choosing the interpolant connecting distributions, and deploying deterministic or stochastic samplers. SiT outperforms DiT on a conditional ImageNet benchmark and achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 with tunable diffusion coeff...
