summary: The paper presents SceneVerse, the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, and Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), a unified learning framework for 3D vision-language learning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of GPS in addressing the challenges of grounding language in 3D scenes and achieve state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks....
