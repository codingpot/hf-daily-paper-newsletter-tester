summary: UniVG is a unified-modal video generation system that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. It classifies tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom categories, using Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to generate videos that align with the semantics of input conditions. It achieves the lowest FVD on the MSR-VTT benchmark, outperforming open-source methods in human evaluations and matching close-source methods....
