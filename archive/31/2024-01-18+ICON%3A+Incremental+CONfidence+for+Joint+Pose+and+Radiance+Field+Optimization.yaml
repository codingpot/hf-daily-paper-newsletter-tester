summary: ICON is an optimization procedure for training NeRFs without the requirement for pose initialization. It estimates initial guesses for poses assuming smooth camera motion and uses an adaptive measure of model quality to dynamically reweight gradients. ICON leverages high-confidence poses and 3D structure to learn NeRF, achieving superior performance versus methods using SfM pose in CO3D and HO3D....
