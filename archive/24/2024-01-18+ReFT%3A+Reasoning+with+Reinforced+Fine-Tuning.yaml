summary: The paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) - an approach that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). It learns from multiple reasoning paths using RL, instead of relying on a single annotated path as in SFT. ReFT outperforms SFT on math problem-solving datasets, and potential improvements can be made by using inference-time strategies. It indicates a superior generalization ability for ReFT...
