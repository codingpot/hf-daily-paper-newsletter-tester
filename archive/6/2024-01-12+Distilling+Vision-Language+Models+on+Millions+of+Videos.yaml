summary: This paper describes a novel approach to generating large-scale video-language models using synthesized data and auto-labeling. By fine-tuning from an image-language baseline, the resulting video-language model performs well on a range of benchmarks, including outperforming the best prior result on NExT-QA by 2.8%. The paper also demonstrates that the model can provide better textual supervision for video-language retrieval tasks, resulting in a 3.8% improvement over the strongest baseline. The ...
