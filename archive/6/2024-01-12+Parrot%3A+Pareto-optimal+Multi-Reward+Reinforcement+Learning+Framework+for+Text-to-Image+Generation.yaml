summary: This paper introduces Parrot, a novel multi-reward RL framework for text-to-image generation that uses batch-wise Pareto optimal selection to automatically identify the optimal trade-off among different rewards during the RL optimization. Parrot also employs a joint optimization approach for the text-to-image model and the prompt expansion network. It includes an original prompt centered guidance at inference time to ensure the generated image remains faithful to the user input and experiments s...
