summary: This paper proposes a method for dynamic novel view synthesis from monocular videos by finetuning a pretrained RGB-D diffusion model and distilling its knowledge into 4D representations that encompass both dynamic and static NeRF components. The method preserves scene identity and demonstrates robustness and utility in challenging cases, as shown in experiments....
