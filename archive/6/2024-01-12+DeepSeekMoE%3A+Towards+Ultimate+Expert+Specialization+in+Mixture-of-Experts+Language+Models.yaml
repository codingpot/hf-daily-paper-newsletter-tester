summary: The paper proposes DeepSeekMoE architecture for mixture-of-experts language models to improve expert specialization and manage computational costs. The architecture involves finely segmenting experts and isolating shared experts to capture common knowledge and mitigate redundancy. DeepSeekMoE 2B achieves comparable performance with GShard 2.9B and nearly approaches the performance of its dense counterpart with the same number of total parameters. The architecture is scaled up to 16B parameters a...
