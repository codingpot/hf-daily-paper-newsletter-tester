summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome the data limitations for high-quality video diffusion models by leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. The authors analyze the connection between the spatial and temporal modules of video models and the distribution shift to low-quality videos and demonstrate the superiority of their proposed method in picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
