summary: This paper presents DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system designed to provide efficient and high-throughput text generation for large language models (LLMs). DeepSpeed-FastGen uses a novel prompt and generation composition strategy called Dynamic SplitFuse and incorporates the techniques of DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference to improve performance. The system delivers 2.3x higher effective throughput, 2x lower latency, and 3.7x lower tail latency compared to state-of-the-art systems. DeepSpeed-FastGen ...
