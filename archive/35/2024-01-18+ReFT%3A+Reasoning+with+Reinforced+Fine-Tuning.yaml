summary: This paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) as an effective approach to enhance the reasoning capability and generalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) by employing online reinforcement learning to learn from a diverse set of reasoning paths, rather than relying on a single annotated reasoning path in Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). ReFT shows significant improvement over SFT in math problem-solving tasks and can further improve performance with inference-time strategies like majority vo...
