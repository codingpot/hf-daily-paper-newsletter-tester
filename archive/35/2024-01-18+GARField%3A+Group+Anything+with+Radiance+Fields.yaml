summary: This paper presents GARField, an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. It uses a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field to embrace group ambiguity through physical scale and optimizes the field from 2D masks provided by Segment Anything (SAM) in a way that respects coarse-to-fine hierarchy. GARField can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via automatic tree construction or user interaction and effectively extracts...
