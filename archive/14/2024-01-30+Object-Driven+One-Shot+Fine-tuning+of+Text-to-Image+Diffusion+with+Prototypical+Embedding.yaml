summary: The paper introduces a new method for generating images from text prompts
  that can handle novel objects and improve generalization and fidelity. This is done
  by initializing a prototypical embedding based on the object's appearance and class,
  and proposing a class-characterizing regularization and object-specific loss. The
  method outperforms several existing works and the code will be released....
