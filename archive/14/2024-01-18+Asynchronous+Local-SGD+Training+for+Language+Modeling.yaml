summary: This paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models. It investigates the impact of factors such as worker hardware heterogeneity, model size, number of workers, and optimizer on learning performance. The paper proposes a novel method using delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjustments in local training steps based on computation speed, which matches the performance of synchronous Local-SGD in perplexity per update step and surpasses it in wall clock t...
