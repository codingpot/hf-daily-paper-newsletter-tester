summary: In this paper, the authors present ICON, an optimization procedure for training NeRFs from 2D video frames without requiring accurate pose initialization. ICON estimates initial guesses for poses using smooth camera motion, and introduces confidence as a measure of model quality to dynamically reweight gradients. The method relies on high-confidence poses and 3D structure to improve learning. Results show that ICON outperforms methods using SfM pose on both CO3D and HO3D benchmarks....
