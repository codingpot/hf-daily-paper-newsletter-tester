summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome the data limitations for high-quality video diffusion models. By leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images, the authors extend the training scheme of video models from Stable Diffusion and finetune spatial modules with high-quality images, resulting in a generic high-quality video model. The proposed method demonstrates superiority in picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
