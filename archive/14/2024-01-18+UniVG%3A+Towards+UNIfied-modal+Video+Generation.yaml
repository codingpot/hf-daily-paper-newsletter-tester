summary: The paper proposes a Unified-modal Video Generation system capable of handling multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. The system is divided into high-freedom and low-freedom video generation categories. The authors employ Multi-condition Cross Attention for higher freedom and introduce Biased Gaussian Noise for lower freedom. The method achieves the lowest Fr√©chet Video Distance on the public benchmark and performs well in human evaluations....
