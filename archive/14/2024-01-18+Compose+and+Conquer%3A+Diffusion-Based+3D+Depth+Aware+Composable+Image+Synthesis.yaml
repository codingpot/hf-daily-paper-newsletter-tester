summary: This paper presents a conditional diffusion model that integrates control over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. The model uses depth disentanglement training and soft guidance to localize multiple conditions in a disentangled manner. The integrated framework, Compose and Conquer, allows for the perception of objects at varying depths and offers a versatile framework for composing localized objects wi...
