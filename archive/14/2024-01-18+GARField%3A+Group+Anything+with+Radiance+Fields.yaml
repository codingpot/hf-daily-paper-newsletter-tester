summary: This paper presents an approach called GARField, which uses a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field to group 3D scenes from posed image inputs, enabling the extraction of groups at multiple levels. This method represents multi-view consistent groupings and produces higher fidelity groups than input masks, with potential applications in 3D asset extraction or dynamic scene understanding....
