summary: This paper proposes a family of generative models called Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), which are built on the backbone of Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT allows for a modular study of design choices that impact generative models built on dynamical transport, ultimately surpassing DiT uniformly across model sizes. The authors explore various diffusion coefficients to achieve an FID-50K score of 2.06....
