summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that uses geometry-aware diffusion to transfer relightable textures from 3-5 input images to target 3D shapes across various categories. It improves upon classical and learning-based methods, requiring fewer casually captured images and transferring highly detailed, intricate textures to arbitrary objects. Personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD) is the core idea, which integrates recent advancements in diffuse models f...
