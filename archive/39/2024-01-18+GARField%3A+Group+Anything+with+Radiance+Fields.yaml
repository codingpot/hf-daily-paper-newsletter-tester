summary: GARField is an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. It embraces group ambiguity through physical scale and optimizes a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field to derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via automatic tree construction or user interaction. Evaluated on a variety of scenes, GARField effectively extracts groups at multiple levels and produces higher fidelity groups than the input masks. The approach has p...
