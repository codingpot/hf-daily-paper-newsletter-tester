summary: The paper proposes a framework called SceneVerse, which is a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset that enables scaling 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments. The dataset includes 68K 3D interior scenes and 2.5M vision-language pairs derived from human annotations and a scalable scene-graph-based generation approach. The paper also introduces Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), a unified pre-training framework for 3D vision-language learning. Experiments show that GPS achieve...
