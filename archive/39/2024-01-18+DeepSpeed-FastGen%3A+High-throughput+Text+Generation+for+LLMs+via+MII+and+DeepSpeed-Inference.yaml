summary: This paper introduces DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system that uses a novel prompt
  and generation composition strategy called Dynamic SplitFuse to improve the throughput
  and reduce the latency of large language models (LLMs) for text generation. The
  system leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference and supports a range of models
  with non-persistent and persistent deployment options. It offers substantial improvements
  in throughput and latency across various models and hardware configurations and
  is...
