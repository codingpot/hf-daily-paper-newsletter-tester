summary: This paper introduces SceneVerse, the first million-scale 3D vision-language
  dataset for indoor environments, and proposes a unified pre-training framework,
  GPS, for 3D vision-language learning. The dataset and framework address challenges
  in 3D scene understanding and scaling, and achieve state-of-the-art performance
  on existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks. The potential of SceneVerse and GPS
  is demonstrated through zero-shot transfer experiments in 3D vision-language tasks....
