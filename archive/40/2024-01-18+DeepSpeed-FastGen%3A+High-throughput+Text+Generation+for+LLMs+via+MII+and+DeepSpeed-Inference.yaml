summary: This paper introduces DeepSpeed-FastGen, a high-throughput text generation system for large language models using Dynamic SplitFuse and DeepSpeed-MII. It delivers 2.3x higher effective throughput, 2x lower latency, and 3.7x lower tail latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, and offers non-persistent and persistent deployment options. The code is available for the community to contribute and enhance....
