summary: ICON proposes an incremental optimization procedure that trains Neural Radiance Fields from 2D video frames without requiring initial camera pose information. It uses smooth camera motion to estimate initial poses and leverages a confidence measure to reweight gradients during optimization. The method achieves improved performance compared to methods that rely on SfM-derived poses....
