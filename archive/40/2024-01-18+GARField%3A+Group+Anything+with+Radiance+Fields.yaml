summary: GARField is an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. It embraces group ambiguity through physical scale and optimizes a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field to derive a hierarchy of possible groupings. GARField effectively extracts groups at multiple levels and represents multi-view consistent groupings. It has potential downstream applications such as 3D asset extraction or dynamic scene understanding....
