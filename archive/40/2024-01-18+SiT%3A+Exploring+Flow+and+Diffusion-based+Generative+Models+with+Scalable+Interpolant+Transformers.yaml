summary: This paper presents Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models that surpasses DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark. SiT uses a flexible interpolant framework, offering modular study of design choices such as learning time, objective, interpolant selection, and sampler deployment. SiT achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 with various diffusion coefficients tuned separately from learning....
