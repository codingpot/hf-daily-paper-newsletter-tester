summary: This paper proposes Vision Mamba, a new vision backbone using bidirectional state space models as computationally efficient alternatives to self-attention. They claim that their model can achieve higher performance compared to state-of-the-art vision transformers like DeiT, while using less computational resources. They also show that their model can handle high-resolution images and has potential to become the next-generation backbone for foundation models....
