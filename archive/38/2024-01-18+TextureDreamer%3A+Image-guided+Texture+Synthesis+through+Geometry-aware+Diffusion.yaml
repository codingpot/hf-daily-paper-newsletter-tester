summary: TextureDreamer is a novel method for transferring relightable textures to target 3D shapes using just 3 to 5 input images, potentially democratizing texture creation. The method uses personalized geometry-aware score distillation, inspired by recent advancements in diffuse models, to improve texture quality and surpasses the visual quality of previous state-of-the-art methods in experiments on real images across different categories....
