summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome the limitations of high-quality video diffusion models that rely on large-scale, well-filtered, and high-quality videos. By exploring the training scheme of video models extended from Stable Diffusion, the authors analyze the connection between spatial and temporal modules and the distribution shift to low-quality videos. They observe a stronger coupling between the modules when fully trained and shift the distribution to higher quality by finetuning spat...
