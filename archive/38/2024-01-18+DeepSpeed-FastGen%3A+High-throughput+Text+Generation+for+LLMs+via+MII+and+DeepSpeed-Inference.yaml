summary: The deployment and scaling of large language models (LLMs) have become critical
  as they permeate various applications, demanding high-throughput and low-latency
  serving systems. Existing frameworks struggle to balance these requirements, especially
  for workloads with long prompts. This paper introduces DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system
  that employs Dynamic SplitFuse, a novel prompt and generation composition strategy,
  to deliver up to 2.3x higher effective throughput, 2x lower latency on average,
  and ...
