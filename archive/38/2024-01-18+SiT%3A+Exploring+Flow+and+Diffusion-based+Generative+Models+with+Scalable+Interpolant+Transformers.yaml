summary: This paper introduces Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models built on the backbone of Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT allows for a modular study of various design choices impacting generative models built on dynamical transport, including using discrete vs. continuous time learning, deciding the objective for the model to learn, choosing the interpolant connecting the distributions, and deploying a deterministic or stochastic sampler. SiT surpasses DiT uniformly...
