summary: ICON is an optimization procedure that trains Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) from 2D video frames without the need for accurate camera pose initialization. ICON estimates initial poses by assuming smooth camera motion, and uses an adaptive measure of model quality called 'confidence' to reweight gradients. ICON improves performance in CO3D and HO3D datasets versus methods that use Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pose....
