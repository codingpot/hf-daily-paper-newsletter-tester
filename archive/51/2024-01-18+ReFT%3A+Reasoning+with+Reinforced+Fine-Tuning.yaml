summary: ReFT proposes a method to enhance the generalization ability of Large Language
  Models for reasoning tasks by employing reinforcement learning. It first warmups
  the model with Supervised Fine-Tuning and then uses the Proximal Policy Optimization
  algorithm to further fine-tune the model by sampling and rewarding reasoning paths
  for each question. Experiments show ReFT outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning on math
  problem-solving datasets and inference-time strategies can further boost its performance...
