summary: This paper proposes DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system that employs a novel prompt
  and generation composition strategy called Dynamic SplitFuse to increase effective
  throughput, reduce latency, and tail latency for large language models (LLMs). It
  leverages a combination of DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference to provide an efficient
  and easy-to-use serving system for LLMs. DeepSpeed-FastGen supports a range of models
  and offers both non-persistent and persistent deployment options. The paper presents...
