summary: DiffusionGPT is a text-to-image generation system that combines Diffusion models and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a unified model capable of handling diverse inputs. The system constructs domain-specific Trees for various generative models and allows the LLM to select an appropriate model based on the input prompt. The system is also designed to integrate domain-expert models and uses Advantage Databases that are enriched with human feedback to align model selection with human preferen...
