summary: This paper proposes a two-stage instruction tuning method for conversational question answering models, called ChatQA, that obtain GPT-4 level accuracies. ChatQA uses a dense retriever to handle retrieval in conversational QA and fine-tunes it on a multi-turn QA dataset, which provides comparable results to using the state-of-the-art query rewriting model while reducing deployment cost. Notably, ChatQA-70B models can outperform GPT-4 on 10 conversational QA datasets without relying on synthetic ...
