summary: This paper critiques the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) evaluation metric for image generation methods. FID's weaknesses include an Inception-v3 feature representation that does not capture the richness and variety of modern text-to-image models, incorrect normality assumptions, and poor sample complexity. The authors argue for the reevaluation of FID and propose an alternative metric, CMMD, based on richer CLIP embeddings and the Gaussian RBK kernel. Empirical evidence shows FID contradicts h...
