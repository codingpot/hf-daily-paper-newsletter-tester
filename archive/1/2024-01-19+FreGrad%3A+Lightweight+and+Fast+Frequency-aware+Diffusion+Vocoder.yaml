summary: This paper proposes a lightweight and fast diffusion-based vocoder called FreGrad that generates realistic audio. The framework consists of using discrete wavelet transform for simpler feature space, frequency-aware dilated convolution for accurate frequency information, and a bag of tricks for improved quality. FreGrad is faster and smaller than its baseline while maintaining output quality. Audio samples can be found at the provided link....
