summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome the limitations of data for high-quality video diffusion models. By utilizing low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images, and investigating the training scheme of video models, the authors introduce a way to obtain a high-quality video model without motion degradation. The proposed method demonstrates superiority in picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
