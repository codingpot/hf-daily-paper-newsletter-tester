summary: The paper proposes a Unified-modal Video Generation system that is capable of handling multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. The system classifies video generation tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom categories, and employs Multi-condition Cross Attention for high-freedom tasks and Biased Gaussian Noise for low-freedom tasks. The method achieves the lowest Fr√©chet Video Distance on the public benchmark and outperforms open-source methods in human evaluations....
