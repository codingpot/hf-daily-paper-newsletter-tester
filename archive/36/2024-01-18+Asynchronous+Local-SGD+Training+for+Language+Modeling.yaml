summary: This paper presents an empirical study on asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models. The authors find that naive implementations of asynchronous Local-SGD take more iterations to converge than synchronous Local-SGD. They propose a novel method that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts workers' local training steps based on their computation speed, which significantly improves performance in terms of wall clock time....
