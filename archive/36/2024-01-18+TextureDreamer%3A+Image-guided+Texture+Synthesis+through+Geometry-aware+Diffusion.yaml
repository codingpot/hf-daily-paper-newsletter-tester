summary: TextureDreamer is a new method for image-guided texture synthesis, allowing for the transfer of relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories. The method, which uses personalized geometry-aware score distillation, can transfer highly detailed and intricate textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects with only a few casually captured images, potentially democratizing texture creation. The approach improves the texture quali...
