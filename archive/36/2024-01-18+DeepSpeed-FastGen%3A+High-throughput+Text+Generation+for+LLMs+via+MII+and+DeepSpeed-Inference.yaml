summary: DeepSpeed-FastGen is a system for high-throughput text generation using large language models. It employs a novel prompt and generation composition strategy called Dynamic SplitFuse, and combines DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference to provide efficient and easy-use serving for LLMs. It achieves higher effective throughput and lower latency than state-of-the-art systems and supports a range of models for diverse user scenarios. It has a detailed benchmarking methodology, scalability analysis, a...
