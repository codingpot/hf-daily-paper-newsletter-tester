summary: TextureDreamer presents a novel image-guided texture synthesis method for transferring realistic textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across categories. It democratizes texture creation by enabling the transfer of intricate textures from real-world environments to any object with just a few casual images. The method uses personalized geometry-aware score distillation, inspired by advances in diffusion models, to integrate and improve texture quality, surpassing the vi...
