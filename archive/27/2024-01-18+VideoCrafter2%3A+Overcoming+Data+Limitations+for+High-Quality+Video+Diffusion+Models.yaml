summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome data limitations in generating high-quality video diffusion models. By analyzing the connection between spatial and temporal modules in video models and investigating the feasibility of using low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images, the paper develops a generic high-quality video model. The method finetunes spatial modules with high-quality images and demonstrates improvement in picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
