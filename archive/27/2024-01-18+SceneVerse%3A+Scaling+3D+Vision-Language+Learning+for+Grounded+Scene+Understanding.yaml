summary: This paper introduces SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset intended for grounded scene understanding. The dataset consists of 68K 3D indoor scenes and 2.5M vision-language pairs generated through human annotations and scalable scene-graph-based generation. A pre-training framework, Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), is employed to unify 3D vision-language learning. GPS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks and shows potential ...
