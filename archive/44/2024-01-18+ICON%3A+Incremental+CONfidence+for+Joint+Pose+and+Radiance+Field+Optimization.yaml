summary: This paper proposes a novel optimization procedure called ICON that trains Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) from 2D video frames without requiring accurate camera poses as input. ICON estimates initial guesses for camera poses based on smooth motion and introduces adaptive measures to reweight gradients and learn 3D structure. Empirically, the method outperforms existing approaches when using SfM poses....
