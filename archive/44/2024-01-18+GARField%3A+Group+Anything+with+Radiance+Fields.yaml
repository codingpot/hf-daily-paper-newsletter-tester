summary: GARField is an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field. The field is optimized from 2D masks provided by Segment Anything and can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via automatic tree construction or user interaction. The method effectively extracts groups at various levels and produces multi-view consistent groupings of higher fidelity than the input masks. The...
