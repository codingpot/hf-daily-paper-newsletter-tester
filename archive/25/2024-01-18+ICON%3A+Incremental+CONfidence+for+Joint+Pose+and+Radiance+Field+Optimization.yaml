summary: ICON is an optimization procedure for training NeRFs from 2D video frames that removes the requirement for pose initialization. It estimates initial guess for poses based on smooth camera motion and dynamically reweights gradients based on adaptive measure of model quality. ICON outperforms methods using SfM pose in CO3D and HO3D datasets....
