summary: This paper proposes a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset called SceneVerse for grounded scene understanding. The dataset contains 68K 3D indoor scenes and 2.5M vision-language pairs generated from human annotations and scalable scene-graph-based approaches. The authors introduce a unified learning framework, GPS, for 3D vision-language learning and showcase its effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks. The paper also demonstrates the vast potential of ...
