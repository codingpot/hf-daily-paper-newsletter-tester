summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that can transfer relightable textures from 3 to 5 input images to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories. Unlike classical methods that require densely sampled views and accurately aligned geometry, or learning-based methods that are confined to category-specific shapes within the dataset, TextureDreamer can transfer highly detailed, intricate textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects with only a few casually...
