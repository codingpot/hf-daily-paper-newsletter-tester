summary: Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT) is a generative model family that extends the Diffusion Transformers (DiT) backbone. SiT explores various design choices affecting generative models built on dynamical transport and outperforms DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark using the same backbone, number of parameters, and GFLOPs. SiT achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 using separate tuning of diffusion coefficients....
