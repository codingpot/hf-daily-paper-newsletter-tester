summary: This paper presents GARField, an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. The approach embraces group ambiguity through physical scale by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field. The field can be derived from user interaction or automatic tree construction. GARField is evaluated on in-the-wild scenes and found to effectively extract groups at multiple levels and produce higher fidelity groups than the input ma...
