summary: This paper addresses the challenges of 3D vision-language grounding in indoor environments, including complexity, data scarcity, and lack of a unified learning framework. The authors introduce SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset with 68K 3D scenes and 2.5M vision-language pairs. They propose GPS, a pre-training framework for 3D vision-language learning, and demonstrate its effectiveness through state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks and zero-shot transfer experime...
