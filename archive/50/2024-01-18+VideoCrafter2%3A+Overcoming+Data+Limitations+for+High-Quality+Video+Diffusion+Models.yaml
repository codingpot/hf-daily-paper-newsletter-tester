summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome the data limitations for high-quality video diffusion models. By leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images and fine-tuning spatial modules with high-quality images, the authors create a generic high-quality video model. Evaluations demonstrate the model's superiority in picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
