summary: The UniVG method is a unified-modal video generation system that handles multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. It revisits these tasks in a new way and classifies them into high-freedom and low-freedom categories. For high-freedom tasks, Multi-condition Cross Attention is used, and for low-freedom tasks, Biased Gaussian Noise replaces random Gaussian Noise to better preserve the content of input conditions. UniVG achieves the lowest Fr√©chet Video Distance on a public...
