summary: TextureDreamer is a new method for transferring relightable textures from
  a small number of input images (3-5) to target 3D shapes across various categories.
  It uses personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD), which incorporates
  recent advancements in diffusion models, to improve texture quality. Experiments
  on real images across different categories show that TextureDreamer outperforms
  previous state-of-the-art in terms of visual quality, potentially democratizing
  texture creation....
