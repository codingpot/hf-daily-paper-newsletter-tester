summary: This paper proposes a new image representation learning method called Vision Mamba (Vim), which uses bidirectional state space models instead of self-attention. Vim mark images with position embeddings and use bidirectional state space models to compress visual representation. Results show that Vim outperforms well-established vision transformers like DeiT while being more computationally and memory efficient. Vim can overcome computational and memory constraints for high-resolution images and h...
