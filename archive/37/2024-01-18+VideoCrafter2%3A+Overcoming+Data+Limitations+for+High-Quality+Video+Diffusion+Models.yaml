summary: This paper presents VideoCrafter2, a method to overcome the limitations of data for high-quality video diffusion models. The authors explore the training scheme of video models based on Stable Diffusion and investigate the feasibility of using low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images to obtain a high-quality video model. They analyze the connection between spatial and temporal modules and the distribution shift to low-quality videos, and finetune spatial modules with high-quality i...
