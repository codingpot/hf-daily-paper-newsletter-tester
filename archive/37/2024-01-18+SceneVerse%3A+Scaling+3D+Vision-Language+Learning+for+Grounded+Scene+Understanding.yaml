summary: This paper introduces SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset for grounded scene understanding. The authors address major challenges in 3D vision-language learning by developing GPS, a unified pre-training framework for 3D vision-language learning. Through extensive experiments, the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates potential for zero-shot transfer in 3D vision-language tasks....
