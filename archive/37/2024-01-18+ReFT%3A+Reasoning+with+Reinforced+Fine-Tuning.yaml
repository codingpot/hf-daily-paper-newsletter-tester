summary: The paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) as an approach to enhance the reasoning capability and generalization ability of large language models for problem-solving tasks such as math problems. ReFT uses Supervised Fine-Tuning initially and then employs online reinforcement learning to further fine-tune the model using multiple annotated reasoning paths and natural rewards derived from ground-truth answers. This approach outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning on several datasets and further i...
