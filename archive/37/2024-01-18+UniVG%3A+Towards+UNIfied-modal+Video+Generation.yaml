summary: UniVG is a unified-modal video generation system that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. It classifies the tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom video generation categories, and employs Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to generate videos that align with the semantics of the input conditions. UniVG achieves the lowest Frechet Video Distance on the MSR-VTT benchmark and surpasses the current open-source methods in human evaluatio...
