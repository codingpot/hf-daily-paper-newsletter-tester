summary: This paper proposes Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models built on the backbone of Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT allows for a modular study of various design choices impacting generative models built on dynamical transport, including discrete vs. continuous time learning, choice of interpolant, and deterministic vs. stochastic sampler. SiT outperforms DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark using the same backbone, parameters, and GFLOPs, and achiev...
