summary: The paper presents VideoCrafter2, a method to train high-quality video diffusion models despite limitations in data availability. It explores the feasibility of using low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images to generate high-quality videos. The authors analyze the connection between spatial and temporal modules of video models and demonstrate the superiority of their method in picture quality, motion, and concept composition through evaluations....
