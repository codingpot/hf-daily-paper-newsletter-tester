summary: This paper proposes a new 3D avatar generation approach called UltrAvatar.
  It improves fidelity of geometry and quality of PBR textures by using two gradient-based
  guidance models. The first model extracts diffuse color to remove unwanted lighting
  effects and the second model generates PBR textures to render face-identity features
  and details better aligned with 3D mesh geometry. This approach outperforms state-of-the-art
  methods in experiments....
