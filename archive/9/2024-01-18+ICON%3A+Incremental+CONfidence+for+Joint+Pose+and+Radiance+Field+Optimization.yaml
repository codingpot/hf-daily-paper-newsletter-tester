summary: ICON is an optimization procedure that trains Neural Radiance Fields for Novel View Synthesis from 2D video frames without requiring accurate camera poses as input. It estimates initial guesses for poses based on smooth camera motion and uses dynamic confidence measures to reweight gradients. By iteratively refining poses and 3D structure, ICON outperforms methods that rely on Structure-from-Motion pose initialization on CO3D and HO3D datasets....
