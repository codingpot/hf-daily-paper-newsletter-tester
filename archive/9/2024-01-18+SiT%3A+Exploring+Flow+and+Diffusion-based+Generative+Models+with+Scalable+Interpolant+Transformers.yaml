summary: This paper introduces Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT allows for flexible design choices in generative models built on dynamical transport and outperforms DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark using the same backbone, parameters, and GFLOPs. SiT achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 by exploring various diffusion coefficients....
