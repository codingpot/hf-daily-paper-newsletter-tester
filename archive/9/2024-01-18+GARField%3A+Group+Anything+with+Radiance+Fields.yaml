summary: This paper presents GARField, an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchical grouping of semantically meaningful objects from posed image inputs. The method uses a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field and Segment Anything masks to optimize the field, respecting a coarse-to-fine hierarchy. GARField can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings and evaluates well on various in-the-wild scenes. The method has potential downstream applications such as 3D asset extraction and dynamic...
