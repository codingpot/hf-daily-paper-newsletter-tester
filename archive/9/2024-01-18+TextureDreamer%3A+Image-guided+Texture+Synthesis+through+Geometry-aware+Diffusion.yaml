summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that allows for the transfer of relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across different categories. In contrast to classical and learning-based methods, TextureDreamer can transfer highly detailed, intricate textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects with only a few casually captured images. The core idea, personalized geometry-aware score distillation, draws inspiration from rec...
