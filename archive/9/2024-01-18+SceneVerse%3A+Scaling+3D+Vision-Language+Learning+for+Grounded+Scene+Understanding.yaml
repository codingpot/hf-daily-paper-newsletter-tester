summary: This paper presents an approach for scaling 3D vision-language learning for grounded scene understanding by introducing a large-scale 3D vision-language dataset called SceneVerse, and a unified pre-training framework, GPS. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results and demonstrates its effectiveness through zero-shot transfer experiments....
