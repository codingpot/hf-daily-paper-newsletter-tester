summary: The paper presents CheXagent, an instruction-tuned foundation model capable
  of analyzing and summarizing chest X-rays, addressing challenges in the development
  of medical image domain models due to limited dataset, lack of encoders, and evaluation
  framework. CheXagent outperforms previously-developed models on CheXbench, a novel
  benchmark for CXR interpretation tasks, and is evaluated for model transparency
  and fairness....
