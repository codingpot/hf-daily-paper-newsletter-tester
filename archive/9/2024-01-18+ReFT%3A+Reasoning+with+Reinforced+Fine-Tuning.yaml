summary: This paper proposes an approach called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) for enhancing the reasoning capability of Large Language Models by employing reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model with a variety of reasoning paths. ReFT significantly outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning on math problem-solving datasets and can further improve performance with inference-time strategies. ReFT achieves better generalization ability than Supervised Fine-Tuning....
