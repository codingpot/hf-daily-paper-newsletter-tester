summary: Make-A-Shape is a new 3D generative model that utilizes a wavelet-tree representation
  to compactly encode shapes, a diffusion model to generate the representation, and
  a subband adaptive training strategy to efficiently train it. The model can generate
  shapes from different modalities and applications, such as unconditional generation,
  shape completion, and conditional generation. It surpasses state-of-the-art results
  and generates shapes efficiently within seconds....
