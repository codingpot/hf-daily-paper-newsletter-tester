summary: This paper presents a diffusion model that integrates control over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. It uses depth disentanglement training to allow the model to identify absolute positions of unseen objects and introduces soft guidance to impose global semantics onto targeted regions. The integrated framework unifies these techniques to localize multiple conditions in a disentangled manner, offering ...
