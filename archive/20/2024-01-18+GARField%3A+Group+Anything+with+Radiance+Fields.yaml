summary: The paper describes a new approach called GARField for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. GARField embraces group ambiguity through physical scale by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field, allowing a point in the world to belong to different groups of different sizes. The method produces multi-view consistent groupings and has potential downstream applications such as 3D asset extraction or dynamic scene understand...
