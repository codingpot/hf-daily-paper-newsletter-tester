summary: This paper presents ICON (Incremental CONfidence for Joint Pose and Radiance Field Optimization), an optimization procedure for training NeRFs (Neural Radiance Fields) from 2D video frames without requiring accurate camera poses for each input view. ICON uses smooth camera motion to estimate initial guesses for poses and introduces 'confidence' as an adaptive measure to reweight gradients. By relying on high-confidence poses to learn NeRF and high-confidence 3D structure to learn poses, ICON out...
