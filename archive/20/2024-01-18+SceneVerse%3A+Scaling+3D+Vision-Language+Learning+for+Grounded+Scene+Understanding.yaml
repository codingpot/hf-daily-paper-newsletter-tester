summary: This paper introduces SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset for indoor environments, and Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), a pre-training framework for 3D vision-language learning. GPS achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks and shows potential for zero-shot transfer in 3D vision-language tasks....
