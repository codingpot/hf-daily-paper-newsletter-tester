summary: The paper proposes a new fine-tuning method called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) for large language models to improve their reasoning capability. Unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) which relies on a single annotated reasoning path for each question in the training data, ReFT uses reinforcement learning to sample and learn from multiple reasoning paths. Experiments on various datasets show that ReFT outperforms SFT and can further improve performance using inference-time strategies. ReFT learns ...
