summary: This paper presents SceneVerse, the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset for grounding language in 3D scenes. It introduces a unified learning framework, GPS, that effectively scales 3D vision-language learning by leveraging both human annotations and a scalable scene-graph-based generation approach. GPS outperforms state-of-the-art on existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks and shows promise in challenging 3D vision-language tasks through zero-shot transfer experiments....
