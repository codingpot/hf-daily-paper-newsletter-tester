summary: The paper proposes GARField, an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. It uses a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field to embrace group ambiguity and optimize it from 2D masks provided by Segment Anything. GARField can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings and is evaluated on in-the-wild scenes, showing effective extraction of groups at multiple levels. The hierarchical grouping can have applications such as 3D asse...
