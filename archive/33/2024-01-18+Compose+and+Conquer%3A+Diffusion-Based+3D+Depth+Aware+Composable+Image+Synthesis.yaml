summary: The paper proposes a conditional diffusion model that incorporates control over three-dimensional object placement and global stylistic semantics derived from multiple exemplar images to address the limitations of text as a source of accurate layout representation in text-conditional diffusion models. The model uses depth disentanglement training and soft guidance to localize conditions in a disentangled manner and offers a versatile framework for composing localized objects with different globa...
