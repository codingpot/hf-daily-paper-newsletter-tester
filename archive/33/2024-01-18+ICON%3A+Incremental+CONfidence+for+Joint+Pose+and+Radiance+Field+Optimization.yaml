summary: The paper proposes ICON, an optimization method for training NeRFs from 2D video frames that does not require pose initialization. ICON estimates initial pose guesses based on smooth camera motion and uses an adaptive measure of model quality (confidence) to reweight gradients dynamically. It relies on high-confidence poses and 3D structure to learn NeRF. ICON outperforms methods that use SfM pose in CO3D and HO3D datasets....
