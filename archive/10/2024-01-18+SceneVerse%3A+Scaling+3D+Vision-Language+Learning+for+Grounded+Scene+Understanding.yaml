summary: This paper proposes a scalable approach to 3D vision-language learning called SceneVerse, which introduces a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset and a unified pre-training framework called GPS. They demonstrate improved performance on existing benchmarks and effective zero-shot transfer for 3D vision-language tasks....
