summary: 'ReFT: Reasoning with Reinforced Fine-Tuning is a proposed approach for enhancing the generalizability of learning Large Language Models for reasoning tasks. The technique utilizes Supervised Fine-Tuning with Chain-of-Thought annotations and then employs Reinforced Fine-Tuning with online reinforcement learning (PPO algorithm) to further fine-tune the model. The algorithm learns from multiple annotated reasoning paths, with rewards derived from ground-truth answers. ReFT outperforms Supervised Fi...'
