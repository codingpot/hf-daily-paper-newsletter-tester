summary: TextureDreamer is a new method for image-guided texture synthesis that can transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across different categories. Unlike classical and learning-based methods, TextureDreamer only requires a few casually captured images and can transfer highly detailed, intricate textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects. The core idea of TextureDreamer is personalized geometry-aware score distillation, which integrates p...
