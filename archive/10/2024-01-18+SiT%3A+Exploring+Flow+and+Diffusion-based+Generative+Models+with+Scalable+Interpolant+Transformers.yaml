summary: SiT is a generative model built on the backbone of DiT that allows for a modular study of design choices impacting generative models. It surpasses DiT across model sizes on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, and achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 by tuning diffusion coefficients....
