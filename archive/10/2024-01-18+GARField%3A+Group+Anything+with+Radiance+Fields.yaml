summary: This paper presents Group Anything with Radiance Fields (GARField), a method for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. The approach embraces group ambiguity through physical scale by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field that can belong to different groups of different sizes. The field is optimized from a set of 2D masks provided by Segment Anything and can be used to derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via autom...
