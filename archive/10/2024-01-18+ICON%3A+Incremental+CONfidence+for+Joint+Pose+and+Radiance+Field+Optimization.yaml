summary: ICON is an optimization procedure for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from 2D video frames that removes the requirement for pose initialization. ICON uses smooth camera motion to estimate initial poses and introduces confidence, an adaptive measure of model quality used to reweight gradients. ICON outperforms methods that rely on Structure-from-Motion pose....
