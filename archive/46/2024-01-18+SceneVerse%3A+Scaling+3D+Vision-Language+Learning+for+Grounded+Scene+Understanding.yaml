summary: This paper proposes a framework called GPS for scaling up 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments by introducing SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset with 68K 3D scenes and 2.5M vision-language pairs. The framework achieved state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks and showed potential for zero-shot transfer experiments in 3D vision-language tasks....
