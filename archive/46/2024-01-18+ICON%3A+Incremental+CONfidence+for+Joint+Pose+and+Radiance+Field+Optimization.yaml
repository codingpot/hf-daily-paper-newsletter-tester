summary: The paper proposes ICON, an optimization procedure that uses 2D video frames and smooth camera motion to estimate initial poses for training NeRFs. It introduces confidence, an adaptive measure of model quality used to reweight gradients, and shows superior performance in CO3D and HO3D compared to methods that use SfM pose initialization....
