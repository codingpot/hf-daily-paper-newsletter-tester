summary: This paper introduces Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT) which is a family of generative models based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT explores flow and diffusion-based generative models with a more flexible framework than standard diffusion models and surpasses DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark using the same backbone, parameters, and GFLOPs. SiT also achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 by tuning the diffusion coefficients separately from learning....
