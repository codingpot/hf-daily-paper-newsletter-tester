summary: This paper presents VideoCrafter2, a method for overcoming the data limitations of low-quality videos for high-quality video diffusion models. The study investigates the feasibility of leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images to obtain a high-quality video model, utilizing an extended training scheme from Stable Diffusion. By finetuning spatial modules with high-quality images, the paper achieves a high-quality video model with superior picture quality, motion, and conce...
