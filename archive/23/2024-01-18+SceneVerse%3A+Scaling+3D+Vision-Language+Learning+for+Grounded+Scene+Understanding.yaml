summary: The paper proposes a method called GPS for scaling 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments by introducing the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse. SceneVerse encompasses about 68K 3D indoor scenes with 2.5M vision-language pairs derived from human annotations and scalable scene-graph-based generation. Using SceneVerse, GPS is demonstrated to effectively address the challenges of 3D scene complexity, scarce data and lack of learning framework, achieving state-of-...
