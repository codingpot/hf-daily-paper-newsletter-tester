summary: TextureDreamer is a method for image-guided texture synthesis that can transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across various categories. It is intended to democratize texture creation by enabling the transfer of highly detailed, intricate textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects using only a few casually captured images. The core idea, personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD), draws inspiration from advancements in dif...
