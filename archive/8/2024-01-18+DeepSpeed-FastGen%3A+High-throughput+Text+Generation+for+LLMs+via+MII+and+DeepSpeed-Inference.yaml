summary: This paper introduces DeepSpeed-FastGen, a high-throughput text generation system for large language models that employs Dynamic SplitFuse, a novel prompt and generation composition strategy. It leverages a combination of DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference and offers both non-persistent and persistent deployment options. Evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements in throughput and latency across various models and hardware configurations....
