summary: TextureDreamer is a new method for image-guided texture synthesis that allows for transferring relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across various categories using personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD). This approach improves texture quality and can transfer highly detailed textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects with just a few casually captured images, potentially democratizing texture creation....
