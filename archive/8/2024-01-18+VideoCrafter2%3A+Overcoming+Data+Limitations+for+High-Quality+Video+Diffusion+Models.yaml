summary: This paper presents VideoCrafter2, which addresses the data limitations for high-quality video diffusion models. The authors explore the training scheme of video models extended from Stable Diffusion and investigate using low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images to obtain a high-quality video model. They analyze the connection between spatial and temporal modules and the distribution shift to low-quality videos and show the superiority of their method in picture quality, motion, an...
