summary: SiT is a family of generative models built on the backbone of Diffusion Transformers (DiT). It allows for a modular study of various design choices impacting generative models. SiT surpasses DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, and achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 by exploring various diffusion coefficients....
