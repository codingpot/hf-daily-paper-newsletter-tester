summary: UniVG is a unified-modal video generation system that can handle multiple tasks across text and image modalities. It classifies tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom categories and uses Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to generate videos that align with input semantics and preserve input content. It achieves the lowest FVD on the MSR-VTT benchmark and performs well in human evaluations....
