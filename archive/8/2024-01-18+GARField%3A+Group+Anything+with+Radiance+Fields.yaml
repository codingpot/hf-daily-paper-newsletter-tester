summary: The paper presents GARField, an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs by embracing group ambiguity through physical scale. It optimizes a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field from a set of 2D masks provided by Segment Anything (SAM) to derive a hierarchy of possible groupings. GARField is evaluated on in-the-wild scenes and found to effectively extract groups at different levels with multi-view consistent groupings an...
