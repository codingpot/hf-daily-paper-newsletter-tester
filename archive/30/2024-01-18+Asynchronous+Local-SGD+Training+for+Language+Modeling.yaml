summary: This paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local SGD for training language models. The study finds that asynchronous Local-SGD takes more iterations to converge than its synchronous counterpart, but proposes a novel method using a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusting worker training steps based on computation speed to match the performance of synchronous Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step and surpass it in terms of wall clock time....
