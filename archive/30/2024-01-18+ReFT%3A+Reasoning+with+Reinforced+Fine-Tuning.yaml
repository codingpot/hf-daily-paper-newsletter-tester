summary: The paper proposes ReFT, a way to train LLMs for reasoning that uses supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a PPO algorithm. ReFT outperforms supervised fine-tuning on GSM8K, MathQA, and SVAMP datasets, and can further be boosted with inference-time strategies such as majority voting and re-ranking. It is effective in learning from the same training questions as supervised fine-tuning, indicating a superior generalization ability....
