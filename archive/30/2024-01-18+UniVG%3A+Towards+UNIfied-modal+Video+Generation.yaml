summary: This paper proposes a unified video generation system called UniVG that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. The system employs Multi-condition Cross Attention for high-freedom video generation and introduces Biased Gaussian Noise for low-freedom video generation. UniVG achieves state-of-the-art results on the MSR-VTT benchmark and outperforms open-source methods in human evaluations....
