summary: This paper presents Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a generative model that builds on the foundation of Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which provides a modular study to explore various design choices impacting generative models. SiT has shown to surpass DiT in a conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark and achieves a lower FID-50K score of 2.06....
