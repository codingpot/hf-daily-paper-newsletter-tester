summary: TextureDreamer is a new method for transferring relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across different categories. It is inspired by recent advances in diffuse models and integrates several modifications to improve texture quality. TextureDreamer improves upon previous state-of-the-art methods and can successfully transfer highly realistic, semantic meaningful texture to arbitrary objects....
