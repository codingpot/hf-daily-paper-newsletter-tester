summary: The paper presents a unified learning framework called GPS for scaling up 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments. It introduces a new dataset called SceneVerse, which is the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, encompassing 68K 3D indoor scenes and 2.5M vision-language pairs. GPS demonstrates effective learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks. The vast potential of SceneVerse and GPS is shown through zero-shot transfer e...
