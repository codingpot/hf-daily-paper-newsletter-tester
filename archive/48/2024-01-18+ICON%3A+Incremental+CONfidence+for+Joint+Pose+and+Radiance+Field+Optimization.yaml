summary: ICON is an optimization procedure for training NeRFs from 2D video frames that eliminates the need for accurate camera pose initialization by using smooth camera motion to estimate initial guesses for poses. The method also introduces 'confidence,' an adaptive measure of model quality used to dynamically reweight gradients, allowing for learning of both accurate NeRFs and poses. ICON achieves superior performance on CO3D and HO3D compared to methods using SfM pose....
