summary: The paper proposes a solution to overcome the data limitations for high-quality video diffusion models. The proposed method leverages low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images to obtain a high-quality video model. The authors analyze the connection between spatial and temporal modules of video models and the distribution shift to low-quality videos, and shift the distribution to higher quality without motion degradation by finetuning spatial modules with high-quality images.
