summary: The paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) as a method to improve the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using reinforcement learning to further fine-tune the model after Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations. ReFT obtains significant improvement over SFT on multiple datasets and can potentially be further boosted by inference-time strategies. The method learns from the same training questions as SFT, demonstrating superior generalization...
