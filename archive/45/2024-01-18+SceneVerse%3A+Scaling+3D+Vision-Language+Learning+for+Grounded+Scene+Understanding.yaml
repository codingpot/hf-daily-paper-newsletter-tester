summary: 'This paper introduces SceneVerse, the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, and GPS, a unified pre-training framework for 3D vision-language learning. By addressing the challenges of complexity, data scarcity, and knowledge distillation, GPS outperforms state-of-the-art on existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks and showcases potential in zero-shot transfer experiments.
