summary: This paper presents DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system designed to improve the deployment and scaling of large language models (LLMs). The system utilizes Dynamic SplitFuse, a novel prompt and generation composition strategy, to deliver up to 2.3x higher effective throughput, 2x lower latency on average, and up to 3.7x lower tail latency. It leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference for efficient serving systems and supports both non-persistent and persistent deployment options. The paper provide...
