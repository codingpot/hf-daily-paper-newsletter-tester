summary: The paper presents GARField, an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field. This field can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via automatic tree construction or user interaction. GARField evaluates on a variety of in-the-wild scenes and finds it effectively extracts groups at different levels. It inherently represents multi-view consistent groupings and produces hi...
