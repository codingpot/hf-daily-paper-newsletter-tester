summary: This paper presents a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse, for grounded scene understanding. The dataset and the proposed pre-training framework, GPS, address the challenges of 3D scene complexity, data scarcity, and lack of a unified learning framework. GPS achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks and demonstrates potential through zero-shot transfer experiments....
