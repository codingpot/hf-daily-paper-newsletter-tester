summary: This paper presents an empirical study on asynchronous Local-SGD training for language modeling, finding that with naive implementations, it takes more iterations to converge than its synchronous counterpart. They propose a novel method that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts workers' local training steps based on their computation speed, resulting in better performance in terms of wall clock time....
