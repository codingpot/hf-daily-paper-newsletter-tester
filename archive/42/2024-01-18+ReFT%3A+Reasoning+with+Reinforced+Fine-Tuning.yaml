summary: ReFT paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) approach to enhance reasoning capability and generalizability of large language models by utilizing chain-of-thought annotations and a PPO algorithm during fine-tuning, resulting in improved performance in math problem-solving datasets GSM8K, MathQA and SVAMP, compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning method....
