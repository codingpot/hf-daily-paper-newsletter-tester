summary: This paper explores the feasibility of training high-quality video models using low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images, addressing the data limitations in text-to-video generation. The proposed method finetunes spatial modules with high-quality images, resulting in a generic high-quality video model with improved picture quality, motion, and concept composition, as demonstrated in the evaluations....
