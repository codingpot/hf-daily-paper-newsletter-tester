summary: This paper presents DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system that employs Dynamic SplitFuse, a novel prompt and generation composition strategy, to deliver up to 2.3x higher effective throughput, 2x lower latency, and up to 3.7x lower tail latency compared to state-of-the-art systems for high-throughput text generation for large language models (LLMs). DeepSpeed-FastGen leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference and supports a range of models, offering both non-persistent and persistent deployment optio...
