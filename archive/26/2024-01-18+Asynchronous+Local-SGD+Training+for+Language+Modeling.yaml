summary: This paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models, finding that it takes more iterations to converge than synchronous Local-SGD despite updating model parameters more frequently. The key challenge identified is momentum acceleration on the global parameters when worker gradients are stale. A novel method using a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusting worker local training steps based on computation speed is proposed, matching the performance of...
