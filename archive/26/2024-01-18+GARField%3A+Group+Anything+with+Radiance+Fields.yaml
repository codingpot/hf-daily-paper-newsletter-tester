summary: GARField is an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. It embraces group ambiguity through physical scale by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field. It can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via automatic tree construction or user interaction and evaluates on a variety of in-the-wild scenes. It produces higher fidelity groups than the input SAM masks and has potential downstream applications such as 3D...
