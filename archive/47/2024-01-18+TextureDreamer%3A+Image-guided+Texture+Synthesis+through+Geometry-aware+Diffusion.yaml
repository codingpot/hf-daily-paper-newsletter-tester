summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that can transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images (3-5) to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories. The method uses Personalized Geometry-aware Score Distillation (PGSD), which is inspired by recent advancements in diffuse models, to extract texture information, synthesize detailed appearance, and guide explicit geometry. Experiments show that TextureDreamer outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods...
