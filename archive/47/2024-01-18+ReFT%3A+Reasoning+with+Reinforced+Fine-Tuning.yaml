summary: The paper proposes ReFT (Reinforced Fine-Tuning) as a solution to enhance the generalizability of learning Large Language Models for reasoning, with math problem-solving as an example. ReFT uses Supervised Fine-Tuning with Chain-of-Thought annotations as a warmup, and then employs online reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model further, where reasoning paths are automatically sampled and rewards are derived from the ground-truth answers. Experiments on several datasets show that ReFT signif...
