summary: The paper proposes a Unified-modal Video Generation system that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities by revisiting the various video generation tasks from the perspective of generative freedom and classifying them into high-freedom and low-freedom categories. The method achieves the lowest Fr√©chet Video Distance on the public academic benchmark and surpasses current open-source methods in human evaluations....
