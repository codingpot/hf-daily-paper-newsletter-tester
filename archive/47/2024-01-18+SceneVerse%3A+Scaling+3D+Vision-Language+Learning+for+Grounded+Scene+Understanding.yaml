summary: The paper introduces SceneVerse, the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset for grounded scene understanding and proposes a unified learning framework, GPS, for scaling 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments. The dataset encompasses 68k 3D indoor scenes with 2.5m vision-language pairs derived from human annotations and a scalable scene-graph-based generation approach. GPS achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks and demonstrates its eff...
