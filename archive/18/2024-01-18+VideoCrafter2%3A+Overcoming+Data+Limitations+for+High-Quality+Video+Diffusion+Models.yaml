summary: The paper proposes VideoCrafter2, a text-to-video generation model that can overcome data limitations to generate high-quality videos by leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. The paper explores the training scheme of video models extended from Stable Diffusion and analyzes the connection between spatial and temporal modules of video models. The method demonstrated its superiority in picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
