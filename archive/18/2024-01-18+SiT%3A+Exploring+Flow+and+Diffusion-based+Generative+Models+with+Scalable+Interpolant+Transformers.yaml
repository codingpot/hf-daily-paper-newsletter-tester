summary: The Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT) framework explores and improves upon Diffusion Transformers for generative modeling, including decision on discrete vs. continuous time learning, choice of objective, interpolant, and sampling method. SiT outperforms DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, achieving a lower FID-50K score of 2.06 through tunable diffusion coefficients....
