summary: This paper proposes DiffusionGPT, a unified text-to-image generation system
  that utilizes both Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain-expert models for diverse
  inputs. The LLM parses the prompt and selects the appropriate model using Trees-of-Thought
  constructed based on prior knowledge, relaxing input constraints and ensuring exceptional
  performance across diverse domains. Additionally, the Tree-of-Thought is enriched
  with human feedback through Advantage Databases for model selection. Experim...
