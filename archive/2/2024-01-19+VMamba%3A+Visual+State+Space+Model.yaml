summary: This paper presents the Visual State Space Model (VMamba), a novel architecture
  that leverages global receptive fields and dynamic weights, while achieving linear
  complexity. VMamba utilizes a Cross-Scan Module (CSM) to traverse the spatial domain
  and convert any non-causal visual image into ordered patch sequences, enabling it
  to perform well on various visual perception tasks, especially as image resolution
  increases....
