summary: The paper presents SHINOBI, an end-to-end framework for the reconstruction
  of shape, material, and illumination from object images captured with varying lighting,
  pose, and background. The framework uses an implicit shape representation based
  on a multi-resolution hash encoding for fast and robust shape reconstruction and
  joint optimization of BRDF and illumination for editing. The method is class-agnostic
  and works on in-the-wild image collections to produce relightable 3D assets for
  various us...
