summary: Recent works demonstrate that using reinforcement learning (RL) with quality rewards can enhance the quality of generated images in text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, a simple aggregation of multiple rewards may cause over-optimization in certain metrics and degradation in others, and it is challenging to manually find the optimal weights. An effective strategy to jointly optimize multiple rewards in RL for T2I generation is highly desirable. This paper introduces Parrot, a novel multi-rew...
