summary: This paper proposes a new vision backbone called Vim that uses bidirectional
  state space models (SSMs) for efficient visual representation learning. It outperforms
  existing vision transformers like DeiT while being more computationally and memory-efficient.
  It has potential to become the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models....
