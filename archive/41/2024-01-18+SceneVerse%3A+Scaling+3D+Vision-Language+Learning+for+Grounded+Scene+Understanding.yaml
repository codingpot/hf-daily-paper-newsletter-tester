summary: The paper proposes SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset to address challenges in 3D scene understanding. They introduce a unified pre-training framework, GPS, for 3D vision-language learning and demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks. The paper explores the potential of scaling 3D vision-language learning through zero-shot transfer experiments....
