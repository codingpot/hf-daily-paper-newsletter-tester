summary: This paper presents Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models that improves upon Diffusion Transformers (DiT) by allowing for a modular study of design choices impacting generative models built on dynamical transport. SiT surpasses DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, and achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 by exploring various diffusion coefficients....
