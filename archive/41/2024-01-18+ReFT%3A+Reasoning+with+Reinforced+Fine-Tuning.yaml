summary: This paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) for enhancing the reasoning capability of large language models, specifically in math problem-solving. ReFT utilizes supervised fine-tuning with chain-of-thought annotations and then employs reinforcement learning to further fine-tune the model. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate ReFT's superior generalization ability and improved performance over traditional fine-tuning....
