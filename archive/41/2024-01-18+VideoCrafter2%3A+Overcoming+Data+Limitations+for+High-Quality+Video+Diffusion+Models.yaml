summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome the limitations of accessing high-quality videos for training text-to-video generation models. The method extends from the Stable Diffusion model and leverages low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images to obtain high-quality video models. The authors analyze the connection between spatial and temporal modules of video models and investigate the feasibility of finetuning spatial modules with high-quality images. Evaluations demonstrate the sup...
