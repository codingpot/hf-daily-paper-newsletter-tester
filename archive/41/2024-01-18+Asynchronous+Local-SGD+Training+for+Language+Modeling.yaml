summary: The paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models, examining factors such as worker hardware heterogeneity, model size, number of workers, and optimizer. With a novel method that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts workers' local training steps based on their computation speed, the proposed approach matches the performance of synchronous Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step while significantly surpassing it in terms of wa...
