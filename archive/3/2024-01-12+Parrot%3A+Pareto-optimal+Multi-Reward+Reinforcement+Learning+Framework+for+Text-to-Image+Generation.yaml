summary: Parrot is a multi-reward reinforcement learning framework that uses batch-wise Pareto optimal selection to optimize multiple rewards in text-to-image generation. It employs a joint optimization approach for the T2I model and the prompt expansion network, enabling quality-aware text prompts generation, and introduces original prompt centered guidance at inference to counteract potential catastrophic forgetting. Parrot outperforms baseline methods across various quality criteria in extensive exper...
