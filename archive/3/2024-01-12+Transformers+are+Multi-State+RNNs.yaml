summary: This paper demonstrates that decoder-only transformers can be conceptualized as infinite multi-state RNNs and shows that pretrained transformers can be converted into finite multi-state RNNs by fixing the size of their hidden state. The paper also introduces a new policy, TOVA, for compressing cache memory in transformer models and shows that it outperforms other baseline policies while being nearly on par with the full model....
