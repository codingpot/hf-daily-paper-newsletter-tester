summary: The paper introduces SPARC, a method for pretraining fine-grained multimodal
  representations from image-text pairs. It proposes learning a grouping of image
  patches for every token in the caption and contrasting token and language-grouped
  vision embeddings through a fine-grained sequence-wise loss that depends on individual
  samples. SPARC combines this fine-grained loss with a contrastive loss between global
  image and text embeddings to learn representations that encode global and local
