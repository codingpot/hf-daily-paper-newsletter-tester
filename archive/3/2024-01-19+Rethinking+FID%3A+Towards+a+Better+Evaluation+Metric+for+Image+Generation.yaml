summary: This paper argues that Frechet Inception Distance (FID), a popular evaluation
  metric for image generation methods, has significant drawbacks. The authors highlight
  FID's poor representation of the content generated by modern text-to-image models,
  incorrect normality assumptions, and poor sample complexity. They propose a new
  metric, CMMD, based on CLIP embeddings and the maximum mean discrepancy distance
  with the Gaussian RBF kernel as a more reliable alternative. The authors demonstrate
