summary: This paper introduces contrastive alignment instructions (AlignInstruct) as a solution to improve machine translation in unseen, low-resource languages using large language models (LLMs). AlignInstruct enhances cross-lingual supervision by incorporating statistical word alignments. The results show that LLMs can translate unseen languages effectively, AlignInstruct consistently improves translation quality, discriminator-based instructions outperform generative ones, and AlignInstruct improves p...
