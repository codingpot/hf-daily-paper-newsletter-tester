summary: The paper proposes a method for dynamic novel view synthesis from monocular videos, addressing issues related to motion and structure differentiation, and occluded or partially observed regions. They finetune a pretrained RGB-D diffusion model and distill its knowledge to 4D representations encompassing both dynamic and static Neural Radiance Fields. The proposed pipeline preserves scene identity and is evaluated through thorough experiments, demonstrating its robustness in challenging cases, an...
