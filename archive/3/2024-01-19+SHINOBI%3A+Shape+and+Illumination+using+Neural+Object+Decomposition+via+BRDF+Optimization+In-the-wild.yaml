summary: The paper introduces SHINOBI, an end-to-end framework for reconstructing
  shape, material, and illumination from object images in various lighting, pose,
  and background conditions. The framework uses an implicit shape representation based
  on multi-resolution hash encoding and joint optimization over shape, radiance, and
  pose for faster and robust shape reconstruction. Additionally, it jointly optimizes
  BRDF and illumination with the object's shape for editing illumination and object
  reflectance. ...
