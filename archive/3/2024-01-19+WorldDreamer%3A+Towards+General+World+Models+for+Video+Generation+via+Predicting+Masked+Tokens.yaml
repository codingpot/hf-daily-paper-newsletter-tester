summary: WorldDreamer is a groundbreaking world model that advances video generation
  by predicting masked tokens from visual inputs across various scenarios. By incorporating
  multi-modal prompts, WorldDreamer captures the complexity of general world dynamics
  and excels in tasks like text-to-video conversion, image-to-video synthesis, and
  video editing. This model showcases its effectiveness in comprehending and predicting
  general world physics and motions....
