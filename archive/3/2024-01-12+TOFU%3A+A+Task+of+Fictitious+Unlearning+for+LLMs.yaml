summary: The paper presents TOFU, a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of unlearning methods for large language models trained on sensitive data. It proposes a dataset of synthetic author profiles and a suite of metrics to assess unlearning efficacy. The paper reveals the limitations of existing unlearning algorithms and motivates further research in this area....
