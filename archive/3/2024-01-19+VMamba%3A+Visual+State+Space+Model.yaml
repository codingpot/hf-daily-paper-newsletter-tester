summary: VMamba is a new architecture inspired by the state space model that combines
  the elements of convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, achieving
  linear complexity and global receptive fields through the addition of Cross-Scan
  Module(CSM) which converts non-causal visual images into ordered patch sequences,
  and demonstrates promising visual modeling performance across various visual perception
  tasks....
