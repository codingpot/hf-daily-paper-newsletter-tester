summary: FreGrad is a lightweight and fast diffusion-based vocoder that generates
  realistic audio. It decomposes a complex waveform into sub-band wavelets, utilizes
  frequency-aware dilated convolution, and employs tricks to improve quality. FreGrad
  is 3.7 times faster to train, 2.2 times faster to infer, and has 0.6 times the model
  size compared to the baseline without sacrificing quality. Audio samples can be
