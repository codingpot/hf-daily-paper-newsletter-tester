summary: The paper presents a novel approach called TRIPS for real-time radiance field rendering that combines ideas from two previous methods to improve rendering quality and maintain high frame rates. TRIPS uses a screen-space image pyramid and a neural network to reconstruct hole-free images, resulting in superior performance compared to existing methods....
