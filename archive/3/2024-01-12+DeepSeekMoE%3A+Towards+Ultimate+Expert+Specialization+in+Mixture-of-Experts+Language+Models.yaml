summary: This paper proposes the DeepSeekMoE architecture to address the challenge of ensuring expert specialization in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models, which can manage computational costs while scaling up model parameters. The architecture involves finely segmenting experts and activating a selective number of them, as well as isolating shared experts to capture common knowledge and mitigate redundancy. The authors demonstrate that DeepSeekMoE achieves comparable performance with GShard and LL...
