summary: This paper presents Object-Centric Diffusion, a technique to increase efficiency in diffusion-based video editing. The paper proposes two novel modifications, Object-Centric Sampling and Object-Centric 3D Token Merging, that allocate computation to foreground edited regions and reduce the cost of cross-frame attention respectively. The modifications can drastically reduce memory and computational costs for both inversion-based and control-signal-based editing pipelines, with a reduction in laten...
