summary: HexaGen3D is a novel approach that utilizes large, pretrained 2D diffusion models to efficiently generate high-quality 3D assets from textual prompts. The approach fine-tunes a pretrained text-to-image model to jointly predict 6 orthographic projections and the corresponding latent triplane, which are then decoded to generate a textured mesh. HexaGen3D offers better quality-to-latency trade-offs compared to existing approaches, can infer high-quality and diverse objects in 7 seconds, and demonst...
