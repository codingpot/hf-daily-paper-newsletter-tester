summary: "Neural network based computer vision systems are typically built on a\nbackbone, a pretrained or randomly initialized feature extractor. Several years\nago, the default option was an ImageNet-trained convolutional neural network.\nHowever, the recent past has seen the emergence of countless backbones\npretrained using various algorithms and datasets. While this abundance of\nchoice has led to performance increases for a range of systems, it is difficult\nfor practitioners to make informed decisions about which backbone to choose.\nBattle of the Backbones (BoB) makes this choice easier by benchmarking a\ndiverse suite of pretrained models, including vision-language models, those\ntrained via self-supervised learning, and the Stable Diffusion backbone, across\na diverse set of computer vision tasks ranging from classification to object\ndetection to OOD generalization and more. Furthermore, BoB sheds light on\npromising directions for the research community to advance computer vision by\nilluminating strengths and weakness of existing approaches through a\ncomprehensive analysis conducted on more than 1500 training runs. While vision\ntransformers (ViTs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) are increasingly\npopular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in a supervised\nfashion on large training sets still perform best on most tasks among the\nmodels we consider. Moreover, in apples-to-apples comparisons on the same\narchitectures and similarly sized pretraining datasets, we find that SSL\nbackbones are highly competitive, indicating that future works should perform\nSSL pretraining with advanced architectures and larger pretraining datasets. We\nrelease the raw results of our experiments along with code that allows\nresearchers to put their own backbones through the gauntlet here:\nhttps://github.com/hsouri/Battle-of-the-Backbones"
