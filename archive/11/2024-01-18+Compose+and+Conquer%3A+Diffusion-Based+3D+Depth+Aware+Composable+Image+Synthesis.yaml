summary: This paper presents a conditional diffusion model that integrates control over 3D object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. The model uses depth disentanglement training to leverage the relative depth of objects as an estimator and introduces soft guidance for imposing global semantics onto targeted regions. The integrated framework, Compose and Conquer, allows perception of objects at varying depths and offers a versatile fra...
