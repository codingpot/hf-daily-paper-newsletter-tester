summary: The paper presents a new optimization procedure called Incremental CONfidence (ICON) for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) from 2D video frames. Unlike existing methods, ICON doesn't require accurate camera pose initialization and only assumes smooth camera motion. It uses an adaptive confidence measure to reweight gradients for better learning of both 3D structure and poses. ICON outperforms existing methods in CO3D and HO3D datasets....
