summary: This paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) as an approach to enhance the generalizability of learning Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning, especially in math problem-solving. ReFT first warms up the model with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then uses online reinforcement learning, specifically the PPO algorithm, to further fine-tune the model by learning from multiple annotated reasoning paths given a question. The paper shows that ReFT significantly outperforms SFT on various da...
