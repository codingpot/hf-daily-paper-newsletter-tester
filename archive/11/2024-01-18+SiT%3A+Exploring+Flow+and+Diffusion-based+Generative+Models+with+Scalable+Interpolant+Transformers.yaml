summary: SiT is a generative model built on DiT, exploring flexibility of interpolant framework for diffusion-based models. It surpasses DiT with modular study of design choices, including learning with discrete or continuous time, objective, interpolant, and sampler. SiT obtains better performance on conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark with lower FID-50K score of 2.06....
