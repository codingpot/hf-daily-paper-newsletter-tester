summary: The paper proposes a method to overcome the data limitations for high-quality video diffusion models by training on low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. They analyze the connection between spatial and temporal modules and distribution shift and finetune spatial modules with high-quality images. The proposed method demonstrates superiority in picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
