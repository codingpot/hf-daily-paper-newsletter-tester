summary: Vision Mamba is a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks that efficiently learns visual representation using state space models. It outperforms existing vision transformers on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks while being more computationally and memory-efficient. The results suggest it could be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models....
