summary: ICON is an optimization procedure for training NeRFs from 2D video frames that removes the requirement for pose initialization by estimating initial guess for poses assuming smooth camera motion. ICON also uses an adaptive measure of model quality to dynamically reweight gradients and achieves superior performance in both CO3D and HO3D datasets compared to methods using SfM pose....
