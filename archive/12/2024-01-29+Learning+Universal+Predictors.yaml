summary: This paper explores the potential of using meta-learning to expose neural
  networks to a broad range of patterns using Universal Turing Machines (UTMs) to
  generate training data. The results suggest that UTM data is a valuable resource
  for meta-learning and can be used to train neural networks capable of learning universal
  prediction strategies....
