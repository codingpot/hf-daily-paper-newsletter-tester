summary: This paper proposes a method called GARField for decomposing 3D scenes into semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. It optimizes a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field to handle group ambiguity and extracts groups at different levels. GARField represents multi-view consistent groupings and has potential applications in 3D asset extraction and dynamic scene understanding. The project website provides more information....
