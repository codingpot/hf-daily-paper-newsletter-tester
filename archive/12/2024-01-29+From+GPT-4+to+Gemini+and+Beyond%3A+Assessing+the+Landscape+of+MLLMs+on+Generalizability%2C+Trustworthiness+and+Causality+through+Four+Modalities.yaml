summary: 'The paper analyzes the performance of proprietary and open-source Multi-modal
  Large Language Models (MLLMs) across four modalities: text, code, image, and video.
  It evaluates the models'' generalizability, trustworthiness, and causal reasoning
  capabilities, using 230 manually designed cases. The study finds 14 empirical findings
  that uncover the strengths and weaknesses of these models, ultimately aiming to
  improve the transparency of MLLMs and support the development of more reliable downstream
