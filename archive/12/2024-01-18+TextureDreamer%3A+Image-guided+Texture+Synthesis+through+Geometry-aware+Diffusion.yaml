summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that can transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories. It uses personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD) and explicit geometry guidance with ControlNet to extract texture information and synthesize detailed appearance. Experiments show that TextureDreamer can successfully transfer highly realistic, semantic meaningful texture to arbitrary objects, surpa...
