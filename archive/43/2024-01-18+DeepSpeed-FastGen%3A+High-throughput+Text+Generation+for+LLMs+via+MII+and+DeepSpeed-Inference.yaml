summary: DeepSpeed-FastGen is a system that uses a novel prompt and generation composition strategy to deliver higher effective throughput and lower latency for large language models (LLMs). It leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference, supports non-persistent and persistent deployment options, and provides a detailed benchmarking methodology. The results show substantial improvements in throughput and latency across various LLM models and hardware configurations....
