summary: ReFT is a proposed method that improves the reasoning capability and generalization ability of large language models (LLMs) by first conducting supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations and then employing reinforcement learning, specifically the PPO algorithm, to further fine-tune the model. This approach automatically samples an abundance of reasoning paths given the question and derives rewards from the ground-truth answers. Extensive experiments on multiple dataset...
