summary: Vision Mamba is a new and efficient vision backbone that uses bidirectional Mamba blocks to learn representations from image sequences, overcoming self-attention's reliance on position embeddings and global context. It outperforms other vision transformers on large-scale vision tasks while being faster and requiring less memory, making it a promising next-generation backbone for vision foundation models....
