summary: This research introduces Taiyi-Diffusion-XL, a Chinese and English bilingual text-to-image model that extends the capabilities of CLIP and Stable-Diffusion-XL through bilingual continuous pre-training. The model efficiently expands vocabulary and enriches text prompts with large vision-language model, resulting in better image captions and higher visual quality. The model outperforms previous models in bilingual image generation and is publicly available for researchers....
