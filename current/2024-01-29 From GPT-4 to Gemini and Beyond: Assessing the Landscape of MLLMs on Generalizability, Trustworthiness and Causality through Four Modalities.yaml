summary: 'The paper analyzes the performance of proprietary and open-source Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across four modalities: text, code, image, and video. It evaluates the models'' generalizability, trustworthiness, and causal reasoning capabilities, using 230 manually designed cases. The study finds 14 empirical findings that uncover the strengths and weaknesses of these models, ultimately aiming to improve the transparency of MLLMs and support the development of more reliable downstream ...'
