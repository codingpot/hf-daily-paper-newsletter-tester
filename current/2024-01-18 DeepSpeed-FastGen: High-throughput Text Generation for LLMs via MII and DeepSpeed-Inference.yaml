summary: This paper introduces DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system for high-throughput text generation for large language models using Dynamic SplitFuse, which delivers up to 2.3x higher throughput and 2x lower latency compared to state-of-the-art systems. It uses a combination of DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference for efficient serving systems and supports non-persistent and persistent deployment options....
