summary: This paper introduces DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system that uses a novel prompt and generation composition strategy called Dynamic SplitFuse to improve the throughput and reduce the latency of large language models (LLMs) for text generation. The system leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference and supports a range of models with non-persistent and persistent deployment options. It offers substantial improvements in throughput and latency across various models and hardware configurations and is...
