summary: DeepSpeed-FastGen is a system that employs Dynamic SplitFuse, a novel prompt and generation composition strategy, to improve the deployment and scalability of large language models (LLMs). It delivers up to 2.3x higher effective throughput, 2x lower latency on average, and up to 3.7x lower (token-level) tail latency compared to state-of-the-art systems like vLLM. It leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference to provide an efficient and easy-to-use serving system for LLMs and supports a rang...
