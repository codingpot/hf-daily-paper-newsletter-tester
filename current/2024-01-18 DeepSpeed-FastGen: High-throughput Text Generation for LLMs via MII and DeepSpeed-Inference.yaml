summary: This paper introduces DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system that uses Dynamic SplitFuse to improve the effectiveness of large language models for various applications. By employing a combination of DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference, DeepSpeed-FastGen achieves up to 2.3x higher effective throughput, 2x lower latency, and 3.7x lower tail latency. It offers non-persistent and persistent deployment options and supports a diverse range of models. The benchmarking methodology and performance analyses demons...
