summary: DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system designed for high-throughput and low-latency serving of large language models, leverages Dynamic SplitFuse and DeepSpeed-MII to deliver up to 2.3x higher effective throughput, 3.7x lower tail latency. It offers both non-persistent and persistent deployment options and supports different models....
