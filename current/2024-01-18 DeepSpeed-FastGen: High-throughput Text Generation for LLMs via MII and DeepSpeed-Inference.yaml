summary: The paper introduces DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system that improves the deployment and scalability of large language models by employing a novel prompt and generation composition strategy called Dynamic SplitFuse. It delivers up to 2.3x higher effective throughput, 2x lower latency on average, and up to 3.7x lower tail latency compared to state-of-the-art systems. DeepSpeed-FastGen's advanced implementation supports a range of models and offers both non-persistent and persistent deployment options. T...
