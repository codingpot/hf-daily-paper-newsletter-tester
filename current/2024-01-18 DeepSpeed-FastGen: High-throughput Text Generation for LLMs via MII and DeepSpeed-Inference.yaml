summary: DeepSpeed-FastGen is a high-throughput text generation system for large language models that utilizes the synergy between DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference, providing efficient serving systems with improved latency-throughput performance. The paper introduces Dynamic SplitFuse, a novel prompt and generation composition strategy, that improves effective throughput up to 2.3x higher, lower latency up to 3.7x and supports a range of models non-persistent or persistent deployment options....
