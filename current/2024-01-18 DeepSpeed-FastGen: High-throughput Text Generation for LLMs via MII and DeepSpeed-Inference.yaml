summary: This paper presents DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system for high-throughput and low-latency text generation using large language models (LLMs). It employs Dynamic SplitFuse, a novel strategy for prompt and generation composition, and leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference for efficient serving. Evaluations show substantial improvements in throughput and latency across various models and hardware configurations, and the code is available for community engagement and contribution....
