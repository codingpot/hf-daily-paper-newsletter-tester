summary: DeepSpeed-FastGen is an efficient and easy-to-use serving system for large language models that uses dynamic prompt and generation composition strategies, DeepSpeed-MII, and DeepSpeed-Inference to increase effective throughput by up to 2.3x and reduce latency by up to 3.7x. It supports a range of models and offers both non-persistent and persistent deployment options, catering to diverse user scenarios. The paper presents a detailed benchmarking methodology and analyzes performance through laten...
