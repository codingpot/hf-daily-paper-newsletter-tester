summary: DeepSpeed-FastGen is a high-throughput text generation system for LLMs that uses Dynamic SplitFuse and DeepSpeed-MII/Inference to achieve up to 2.3x higher effective throughput and 2x lower latency compared to state-of-the-art systems. It offers advanced implementation options and provides both non-persistent and persistent deployment. Benchmarking, latency-throughput analysis, and load balancing scalability are presented, with substantial improvements in throughput and latency across various mo...
