summary: DeepSpeed-FastGen is a system that uses Dynamic SplitFuse and DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference to improve the high-throughput text generation for large language models (LLMs). It offers efficent and easy-to-use serving system for LLMs, with advanced implementation supporting various models and deployment options. The system delivers up to 2.3x higher effective throughput, 2x lower latency, and up to 3.7x lower tail latency compared to state-of-the-art systems. Benchmarking methodology and p...
