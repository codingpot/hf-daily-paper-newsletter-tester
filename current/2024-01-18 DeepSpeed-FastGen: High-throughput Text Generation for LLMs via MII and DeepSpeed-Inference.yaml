summary: This paper introduces DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system that improves the performance of Large Language Models by balancing the demands of high throughput and low latency serving systems. DeepSpeed-FastGen uses Dynamic SplitFuse and leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference to offer efficient and easy-to-use serving system for LLMs. Evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements in throughput and latency across various models and hardware configurations....
