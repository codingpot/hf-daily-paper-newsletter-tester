summary: This paper introduces DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system that employs Dynamic SplitFuse and leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference to provide a high-throughput and low-latency serving system for large language models (LLMs). It offers advanced implementation for diverse models and deployment options, and presents a detailed benchmarking methodology. Evaluations show substantial improvements in throughput and latency across various models and hardware configurations....
