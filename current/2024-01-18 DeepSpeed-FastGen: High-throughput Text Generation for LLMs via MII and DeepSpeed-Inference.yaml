summary: The paper proposes DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system for efficient and high-throughput text generation using large language models. The system employs Dynamic SplitFuse, a novel prompt and generation composition strategy, and leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference to improve performance. Benchmark results show improved throughput and lower latency compared to state-of-the-art systems. The code is available for community contribution....
