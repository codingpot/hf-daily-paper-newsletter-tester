summary: This paper proposes DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system that uses dynamic prompt and generation composition to improve throughput and reduce latency for large language model deployment and scaling. DeepSpeed-FastGen leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference technology and supports non-persistent and persistent deployment options for a variety of models. The evaluations show significant improvements in throughput and latency across various models and hardware configurations, and the code is availab...
