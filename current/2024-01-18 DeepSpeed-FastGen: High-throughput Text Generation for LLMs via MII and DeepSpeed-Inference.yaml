summary: DeepSpeed-FastGen is a system that uses Dynamic SplitFuse, a novel prompt and generation composition strategy, to deliver high-throughput and low-latency text generation for large language models. It leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference for efficient serving, and supports a range of models with both non-persistent and persistent deployment options. Through benchmarking and analysis, the paper shows substantial improvements in throughput and latency across various models and hardware c...
