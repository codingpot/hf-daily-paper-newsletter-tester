summary: This paper introduces StreamVoice, a novel streaming language model-based model for zero-shot voice conversion, enabling real-time conversion with arbitrary speaker prompts and source speech. The model employs a fully causal context-aware language model with a temporal-independent acoustic predictor, and alternately processes semantic and acoustic features at each time step of autoregression. The authors enhance the context-awareness of the language model through teacher-guided context foresight...
