summary: The paper introduces StreamVoice, a novel streaming language model-based zero-shot voice conversion model that enables real-time conversion using arbitrary speaker prompts and source speech. StreamVoice employs a causal context-aware model with an acoustic predictor that alternately processes semantic and acoustic features. It also uses context-awareness enhancement strategies, such as teacher-guided context foresight and semantic masking, to address potential performance degradation from incomp...
