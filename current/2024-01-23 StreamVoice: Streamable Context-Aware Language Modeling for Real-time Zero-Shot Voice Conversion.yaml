summary: This paper proposes StreamVoice, a streaming language model-based zero-shot voice conversion model that can perform real-time conversion of arbitrary speaker prompts and source speech. It uses a fully causal context-aware LM with a temporal-independent acoustic predictor and a teacher-guided context foresight and semantic masking strategy to enhance the context-awareness of the LM. StreamVoice is the first LM-based streaming zero-shot VC model without any future look-ahead and maintains comparab...
