summary: 'This paper introduces StreamVoice, a novel streaming LM-based model for zero-shot voice conversion that enables real-time conversion given arbitrary speaker prompts and source speech. It employs a fully causal context-aware LM with a temporal-independent acoustic predictor and alternately processes semantic and acoustic features at each time step. To address potential performance degradation, it enhances the context-awareness of the LM through two strategies: teacher-guided context foresight and...'
