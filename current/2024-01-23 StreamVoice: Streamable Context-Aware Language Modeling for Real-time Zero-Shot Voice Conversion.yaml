summary: 'This paper presents StreamVoice, a novel streaming language model-based voice conversion model that can convert voice in real-time given arbitrary speaker prompts and source speech. It uses a fully causal context-aware LM with a temporal-independent acoustic predictor, and enhances the context-awareness through two strategies: teacher-guided context foresight and semantic masking strategy. StreamVoice is the first LM-based streaming zero-shot VC model without any future look-ahead....'
