summary: StreamVoice is a novel, real-time, zero-shot voice conversion model that utilizes a context-aware language model to process semantic and acoustic features alternately, enabling streaming capability and eliminating dependence on complete source speech. Its context-awareness is enhanced through teacher-guided context foresight and semantic masking strategy. StreamVoice is the first LM-based streaming zero-shot VC model without any future look-ahead and maintains comparable performance to non-strea...
