summary: 'The paper proposes a novel streaming language model-based model called StreamVoice for real-time zero-shot voice conversion. It uses a fully causal context-aware language model with a temporal-independent acoustic predictor and alternately processes semantic and acoustic features, eliminating the dependence on complete source speech. The model also employs two strategies to enhance its context-awareness: teacher-guided context foresight and a semantic masking strategy. Results show that StreamVo...'
