summary: The paper proposes a unified-modal video generation system called UniVG that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. It categorizes these tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom video generation categories, and uses Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to generate videos that align with the semantics of the input conditions and preserve content, respectively. UniVG achieves the lowest FVD on the MSR-VTT benchmark and outperforms open-sour...
