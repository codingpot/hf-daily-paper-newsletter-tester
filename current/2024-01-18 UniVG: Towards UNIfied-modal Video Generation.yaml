summary: This paper proposes a system for Unified-modal Video Generation that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities, classifying them into high-freedom and low-freedom video generation categories. It achieves the lowest Fr√©chet Video Distance and outperforms open-source methods in human evaluations, and is on par with the current close-source method Gen2....
