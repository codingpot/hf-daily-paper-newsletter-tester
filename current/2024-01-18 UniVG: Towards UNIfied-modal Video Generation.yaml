summary: This paper presents UniVG, a unified-modal video generation system that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. The authors reclassify video generation tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom categories and propose Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to generate videos that align with input semantics and better preserve input content, respectively. UniVG achieves the lowest Fr√©chet Video Distance on the MSR-VTT benchmark and outperforms...
