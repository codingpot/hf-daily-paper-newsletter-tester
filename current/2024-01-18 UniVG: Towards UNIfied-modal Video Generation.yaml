summary: The paper proposes a Unified-modal Video Generation system that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. It classifies tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom categories and employs Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to generate videos that align with input semantics and preserve input conditions. The method achieves the lowest Fr√©chet Video Distance on the public academic benchmark and surpasses current open-source methods in human eva...
