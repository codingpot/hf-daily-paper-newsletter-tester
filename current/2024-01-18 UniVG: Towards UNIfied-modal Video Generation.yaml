summary: The paper proposes a Unified-modal Video Genearation system that is capable of handling multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. The authors revisit the various video generation tasks within their system from the perspective of generative freedom and classify them into high-freedom and low-freedom video generation categories. This allows for handling multiple video generation tasks, such as image or text, with a single system. The authors introduce Multi-condition Cross ...
