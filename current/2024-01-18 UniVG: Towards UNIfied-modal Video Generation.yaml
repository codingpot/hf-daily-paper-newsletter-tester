summary: The paper proposes a Unified-modal Video Generation system that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. The authors classify the video generation tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom categories and introduce Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to improve the performance of the system. The method achieves the lowest Fr√©chet Video Distance on the MSR-VTT benchmark and performs well in human evaluations....
