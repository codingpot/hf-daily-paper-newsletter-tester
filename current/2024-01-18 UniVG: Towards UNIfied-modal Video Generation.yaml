summary: This paper proposes a unified-modal video generation system called UniVG that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. The system classifies tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom categories and uses Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to generate videos that align with input semantics and preserve content, respectively. UniVG achieves the lowest Fr√©chet Video Distance on the MSR-VTT benchmark and outperforms open-source methods in huma...
