summary: The paper proposes a Unified-Modal Video Generation (UniVG) system capable of handling multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. It revises tasks in terms of generative freedom, classifying them into high-freedom and low-freedom categories. For high-freedom generation, Multi-condition Cross Attention is used, while for low-freedom, Biased Gaussian Noise replaces pure random Gaussian Noise. UniVG achieves the lowest Frechet Video Distance on the MSR-VTT benchmark, outperfo...
