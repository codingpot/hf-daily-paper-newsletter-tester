summary: UniVG is a unified-modal video generation system that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. It employs Multi-condition Cross Attention for high-freedom video generation and Biased Gaussian Noise for low-freedom video generation, achieving the lowest Frechet Video Distance on the public academic benchmark MSR-VTT and outperforming current open-source methods in human evaluations....
