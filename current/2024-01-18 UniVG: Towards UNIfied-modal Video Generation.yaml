summary: This paper proposes a unified video generation system, UniVG, that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. The authors use Multi-condition Cross Attention for high-freedom video generation and Biased Gaussian Noise for low-freedom generation to better align the videos with the input conditions and preserve their content. UniVG achieves state-of-the-art results on the MSR-VTT benchmark and outperforms open-source methods in human evaluations....
