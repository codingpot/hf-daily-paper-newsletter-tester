summary: UniVG proposes a unified-modal video generation system that can handle multiple
  video generation tasks across text and image modalities. It revisits the various
  video generation tasks, classifying them into high-freedom and low-freedom categories,
  and achieves the lowest Frechet Video Distance on the public academic benchmark
  MSR-VTT, surpassing current open-source methods in human evaluations and being on
  par with the current close-source method Gen2. More samples can be found at <https://univg...
