summary: This paper proposes a Unified-modal Video Generation system that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. The system classifies video generation tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom categories and uses Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to generate videos that align with the input images or text. The method achieves the lowest Fr√©chet Video Distance on the public academic benchmark and performs well in human evaluations....
