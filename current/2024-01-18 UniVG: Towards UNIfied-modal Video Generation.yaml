summary: UniVG proposes a Unified-modal Video Generation system that is capable of handling multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. It categorizes tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom video generation and employs Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to improve semantic alignment and content preservation. The method achieves the lowest FVD on the public benchmark MSR-VTT and is on par with the current close-source method Gen2....
