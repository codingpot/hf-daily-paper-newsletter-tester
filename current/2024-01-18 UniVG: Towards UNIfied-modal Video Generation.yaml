summary: The Unified-modal Video Generation system is proposed for multi-modal video generation tasks. It classifies tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom categories and uses Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to align with input semantics and preserve content, respectively. It achieves the best results on the MSR-VTT benchmark and performs well in human evaluations....
