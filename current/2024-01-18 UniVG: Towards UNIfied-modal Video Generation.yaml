summary: The paper proposes a Unified-modal Video Generation system that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities by revisiting them from the perspective of generative freedom and classifying them into high-freedom and low-freedom categories. The method achieves the lowest Frechet Video Distance (FVD) on the public academic benchmark MSR-VTT, surpasses open-source methods in human evaluations, and is on par with the current close-source method Gen2. More samples can be ...
