summary: UniVG is a unified-modal video generation system that can handle multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. It revisits the various video generation tasks within the system from the perspective of generative freedom and classifies them into high-freedom and low-freedom video generation categories. The method achieves the lowest Fr√©chet Video Distance (FVD) on the public academic benchmark MSR-VTT and outperforms the current open-source methods in human evaluations....
