summary: The paper presents a Unified-modal Video Generation (UniVG) system that allows for handling multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. The system classifies video generation tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom categories and uses Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to generate videos that align with the semantics of input conditions. The method achieves the lowest Frechet Video Distance on a public benchmark and outperforms open-source methods in ...
