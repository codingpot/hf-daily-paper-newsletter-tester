summary: Parrot is a multi-reward reinforcement learning framework for text-to-image generation that uses batch-wise Pareto optimal selection to automatically balance multiple rewards and jointly optimize the T2I model and prompt expansion network. It also uses original prompt centered guidance to ensure the generated image remains faithful to the user input. Experiments and a user study show that Parrot outperforms several baseline methods across various quality criteria....
