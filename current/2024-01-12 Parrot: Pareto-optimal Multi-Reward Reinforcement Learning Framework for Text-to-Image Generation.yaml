summary: This paper proposes Parrot, a multi-reward reinforcement learning framework for text-to-image generation that uses batch-wise Pareto optimal selection to automatically identify the optimal trade-off among different rewards during optimization. It also employs a joint optimization approach for the text-to-image model and the prompt expansion network, and introduces original prompt centered guidance at inference time to ensure the generated image remains faithful to the user input. Experiments and...
