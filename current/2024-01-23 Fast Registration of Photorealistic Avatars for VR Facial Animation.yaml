summary: 'Virtual Reality (VR) bares promise of immersive social interactions, and key to this is photorealistic facial animation of one''s avatar. Although high quality registration of person-specific avatars to headset-mounted camera (HMC) images possible in offline setting, generic realtime models degraded. This work presents system design that decouples problem into 2 parts: 1) iterative refinement module that takes in-domain inputs, and 2) avatar-guided image-to-image style transfer module conditioned...'
