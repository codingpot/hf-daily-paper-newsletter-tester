summary: 'This paper presents a system that allows for fast and accurate registration of photorealistic avatars for VR facial animation. The system utilizes a transformer-based architecture that decouples the problem into two parts: an iterative refinement module and a generic avatar-guided image-to-image style transfer module. The system produces high-quality results efficiently, obviating the need for costly offline registration to generate personalized labels. The method is validated through experiment...'
