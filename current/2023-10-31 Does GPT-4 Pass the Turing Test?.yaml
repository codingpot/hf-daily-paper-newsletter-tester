summary: We evaluated GPT-4 in a public online Turing Test. The best-performing GPT-4\nprompt passed in 41% of games, outperforming baselines set by ELIZA (27%) and\nGPT-3.5 (14%), but falling short of chance and the baseline set by human\nparticipants (63%). Participants' decisions were based mainly on linguistic\nstyle (35%) and socio-emotional traits (27%), supporting the idea that\nintelligence is not sufficient to pass the Turing Test. Participants'\ndemographics, including education and familiarity with LLMs, did not predict\ndetection rate, suggesting that even those who understand systems deeply and\ninteract with them frequently may be susceptible to deception. Despite known\nlimitations as a test of intelligence, we argue that the Turing Test continues\nto be relevant as an assessment of naturalistic communication and deception. AI\nmodels with the ability to masquerade as humans could have widespread societal\nconsequences, and we analyse the effectiveness of different strategies and\ncriteria for judging humanlikeness.
opinion: Looks amazing!
