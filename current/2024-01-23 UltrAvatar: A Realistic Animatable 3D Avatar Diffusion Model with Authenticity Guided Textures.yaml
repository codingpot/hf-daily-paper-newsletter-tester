summary: This paper presents a new approach for generating realistic 3D avatars with high-quality textures. The approach uses a diffusion model with guidance from a diffuse color extraction model and an authenticity-guided texture diffusion model to create avatars with diverse facial features and details, while avoiding oversmoothing and unwanted lighting effects. The results outperform state-of-the-art methods....
