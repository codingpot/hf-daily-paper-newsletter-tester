summary: UltrAvatar is a novel 3D avatar generation approach that uses a diffusion model with text conditioning and a differentiable renderer to generate realistic, animatable avatars with high-quality PBR textures. It includes a diffuse color extraction model to remove unwanted lighting effects and an authenticity guided texture diffusion model to generate diverse face-identity features and details. The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments....
