summary: This paper proposes a new 3D avatar generation approach called UltrAvatar. It improves fidelity of geometry and quality of PBR textures by using two gradient-based guidance models. The first model extracts diffuse color to remove unwanted lighting effects and the second model generates PBR textures to render face-identity features and details better aligned with 3D mesh geometry. This approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments....
