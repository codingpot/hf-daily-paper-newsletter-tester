summary: The paper presents a novel 3D avatar generation approach, UltrAvatar, that has enhanced fidelity of geometry and superior quality of physically based rendering textures. The approach includes a diffuse color extraction model and an authenticity guided texture diffusion model. The former removes unwanted lighting effects, while the latter uses gradient-based guidances to generate PBR textures that better align with the 3D mesh geometry. The method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experimen...
