summary: This paper proposes a novel 3D avatar generation approach called UltrAvatar, which aims to generate realistic and animatable avatars with high-quality PBR textures. The approach includes a diffuse color extraction model and an authenticity guided texture diffusion model to remove unwanted lighting effects and generate diverse face-identity features. The results show that UltrAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating high-fidelity 3D avatars....
