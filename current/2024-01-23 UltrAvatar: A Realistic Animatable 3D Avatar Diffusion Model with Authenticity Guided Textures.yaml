summary: This paper presents a new approach for generating realistic 3D avatars with
  high-quality textures. The approach uses a diffusion model with guidance from a
  diffuse color extraction model and an authenticity-guided texture diffusion model
  to create avatars with diverse facial features and details, while avoiding oversmoothing
  and unwanted lighting effects. The results outperform state-of-the-art methods....
