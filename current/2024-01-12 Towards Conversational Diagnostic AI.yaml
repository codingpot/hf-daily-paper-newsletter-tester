summary: This paper introduces AMIE, an AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue using a Large Language Model. AMIE was compared to primary care physicians in a randomized controlled trial and demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on most axes of performance. The study has limitations and further research is required before AMIE can be translated to real-world settings, but these results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI....
