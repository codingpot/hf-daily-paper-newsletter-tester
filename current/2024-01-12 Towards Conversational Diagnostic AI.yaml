summary: The paper introduces AMIE, a Large Language Model based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue and uses a novel self-play based simulated environment for learning. AMIE was compared to primary care physicians' performance in a randomized, double-blind study and demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on most axes according to both specialist physicians and patient actors. However, the study has limitations as clinicians were limited to unfamiliar synchronous text-c...
