summary: The SPARC method improves fine-grained image-text pre-training by learning a grouping of image patches for every token in the caption and contrasting token and language-grouped vision embeddings through a fine-grained sequence-wise loss. The approach combines this fine-grained loss with a contrastive loss to learn representations that encode both global and local information. The proposed method is evaluated and shows improved performance on various image and region-level tasks....
