summary: The paper proposes a new method called SPARC for pre-training fine-grained multimodal representations from image-text pairs. SPARC learns a grouping of image patches for every token in the caption using a sparse similarity metric between image patches and language tokens. It then computes a language-grouped vision embedding for each token, which is contrasted with the token embedding through a fine-grained sequence-wise loss. SPARC is evaluated and shows improved performance on both image-level ...
