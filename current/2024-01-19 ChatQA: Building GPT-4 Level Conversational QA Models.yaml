summary: The paper introduced ChatQA, a family of conversational question answering (QA) models that obtain GPT-4 level accuracies using a two-stage instruction tuning method. The models fine-tune a dense retriever on a multi-turn QA dataset to handle retrieval, and ChatQA-70B outperforms GPT-4 in terms of average score on 10 conversational QA datasets without relying on synthetic data from GPT models....
