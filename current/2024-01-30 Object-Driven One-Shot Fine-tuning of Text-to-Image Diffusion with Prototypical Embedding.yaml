summary: The paper introduces a new method for generating images from text prompts that can handle novel objects and improve generalization and fidelity. This is done by initializing a prototypical embedding based on the object's appearance and class, and proposing a class-characterizing regularization and object-specific loss. The method outperforms several existing works and the code will be released....
