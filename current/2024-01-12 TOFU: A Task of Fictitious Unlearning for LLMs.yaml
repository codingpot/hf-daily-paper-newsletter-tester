summary: TOFU (Task of Fictitious Unlearning) is a benchmark for assessing unlearning methods that aim to remove sensitive or private data learned during training of large language models. It offers a synthetic dataset of author profiles and metrics to measure unlearning efficacy. The authors provide baseline results, but none showed effective unlearning, highlighting the need for further research in this area....
