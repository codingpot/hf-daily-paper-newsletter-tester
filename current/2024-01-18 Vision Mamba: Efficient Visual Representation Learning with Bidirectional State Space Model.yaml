summary: This paper proposes a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim) for efficient and generic visual representation learning with state space models. Vim demonstrates higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also being more computationally and memory efficient. Vim has the potential to become the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models and is available on GitHub....
