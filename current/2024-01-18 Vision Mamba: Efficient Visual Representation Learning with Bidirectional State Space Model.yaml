summary: This paper proposes a new generic vision backbone called Vim that uses bidirectional Mamba blocks for efficient visual representation learning. Unlike existing vision transformers, Vim is capable of marking image sequences with position embeddings and compressing visual representation with bidirectional state space models. Vim is shown to achieve higher performance on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks with significant improvement in computatio...
