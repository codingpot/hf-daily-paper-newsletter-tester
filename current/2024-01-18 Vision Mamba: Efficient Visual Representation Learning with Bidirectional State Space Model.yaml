summary: The paper proposes a new generic vision backbone called Vision Mamba (Vim) which uses bidirectional state space models for efficient visual representation learning. Vim improves performance on various vision tasks compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also being more computationally and memory efficient. The results demonstrate Vim's potential to become the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models and the code is available on GitHub....
