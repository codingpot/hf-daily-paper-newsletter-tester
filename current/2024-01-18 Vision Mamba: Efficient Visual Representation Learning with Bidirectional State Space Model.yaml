summary: This paper proposes a new vision backbone called Vision Mamba (Vim), which uses bidirectional state space models to learn efficient visual representations. Vim outperforms well-established vision transformers like DeiT while demonstrating significant computation and memory efficiency improvements. The results indicate that Vim has the potential to become the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models. The code is available at <https://github.com/hustvl/Vim>....
