summary: The paper proposes a new generic vision backbone called Vision Mamba (Vim)
  that leverages bidirectional state space models for efficient visual representation
  learning. Unlike traditional self-attention methods, Vim uses position embeddings
  and bidirectional SSMs to compress visual representation, resulting in higher performance
  and improved computation & memory efficiency on image classification, object detection,
  and semantic segmentation tasks. Vim outperforms DeiT and saves up to 86.8% GPU
