summary: The paper proposes a new generic vision backbone called Vision Mamba (Vim) that leverages bidirectional state space models for efficient visual representation learning. Unlike traditional self-attention methods, Vim uses position embeddings and bidirectional SSMs to compress visual representation, resulting in higher performance and improved computation & memory efficiency on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks. Vim outperforms DeiT and saves up to 86.8% GPU m...
