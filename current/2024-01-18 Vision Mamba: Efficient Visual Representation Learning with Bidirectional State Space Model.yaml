summary: The paper proposes a new generic vision backbone called Vision Mamba (Vim) which uses bidirectional state space models to efficiently learn visual representations. Vim improves upon state-of-the-art vision transformers like DeiT, while also being more computationally and memory efficient. The backbone has potential to become the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models....
