summary: This paper proposes a new vision backbone, Vision Mamba (Vim), that uses bidirectional state space models for efficient and generic visual representation learning. Vim shows improved performance and computation & memory efficiency compared to existing vision transformers like DeiT, with 2.8x faster performance and 86.8% GPU memory savings. It has the potential to become a next-generation backbone for vision foundation models....
