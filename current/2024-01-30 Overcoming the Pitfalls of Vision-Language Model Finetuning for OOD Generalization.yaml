summary: This paper proposes a novel approach, OGEN, to improve the out-of-distribution
  (OOD) generalization of finetuned vision-language models. The method uses a class-conditional
  feature generator to synthesize OOD features and an adaptive self-distillation mechanism
  for regularization during joint optimization. The results show that OGEN significantly
  enhances OOD generalization performance....
