summary: This paper presents a conditional diffusion model that integrates control over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. The model leverages depth disentanglement training and soft guidance techniques to unify localization of multiple conditions in a disentangled manner, resulting in a versatile framework for composing localized objects with different global semantics while offering perception of objects at v...
