summary: This paper presents a conditional diffusion model that integrates control over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. The model utilizes depth disentanglement training and soft guidance to allow the perception of objects at varying depths while offering a versatile framework for composing localized objects with different global semantics. The integrated framework, Compose and Conquer (CnC), combines these ...
