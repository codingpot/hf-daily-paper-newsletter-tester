summary: The paper presents a conditional diffusion model that integrates control over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. It leverages depth disentanglement training and soft guidance to localize multiple conditions in a disentangled manner, allowing perception of objects at varying depths while offering a versatile framework for composing localized objects with different global semantics....
