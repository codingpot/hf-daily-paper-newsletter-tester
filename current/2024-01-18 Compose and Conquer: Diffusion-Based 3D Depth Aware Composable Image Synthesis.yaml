summary: This paper presents a conditional diffusion model that allows for control over three-dimensional object placement and disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. It introduces depth disentanglement training and soft guidance to localize multiple conditions in a disentangled manner. The integrated framework, Compose and Conquer, allows perception of objects at varying depths while offering a versatile framework for composing localized objects with dif...
