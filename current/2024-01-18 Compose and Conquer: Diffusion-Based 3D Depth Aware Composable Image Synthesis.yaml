summary: This paper presents a conditional diffusion model called Compose and Conquer (CnC) that allows control over three-dimensional object placement and unifies techniques to localize multiple conditions in a disentangled manner. The model incorporates depth disentanglement training and soft guidance to estimate the absolute positions of unseen objects and impose global semantics, respectively. CnC enables the perception of objects at varying depths and offers a versatile framework for composing local...
