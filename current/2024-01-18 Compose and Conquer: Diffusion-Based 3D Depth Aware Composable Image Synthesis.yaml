summary: This paper presents a conditional diffusion model that integrates control over 3D object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images, called Compose and Conquer (CnC). CnC introduces depth disentanglement training and soft guidance to allow perception of objects at varying depths while offering a versatile framework for composing localized objects with different global semantics. The CnC framework unifies these techniques to localize mu...
