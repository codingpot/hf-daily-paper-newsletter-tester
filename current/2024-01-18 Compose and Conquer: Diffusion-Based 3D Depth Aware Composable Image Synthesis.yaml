summary: This paper presents a conditional diffusion model that integrates control over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics. The model uses depth disentanglement training to leverage the relative depth of objects as an estimator, allowing the model to identify the absolute positions of unseen objects through the use of synthetic image triplets. Additionally, soft guidance is introduced, a method for imposing global semantics onto targeted reg...
