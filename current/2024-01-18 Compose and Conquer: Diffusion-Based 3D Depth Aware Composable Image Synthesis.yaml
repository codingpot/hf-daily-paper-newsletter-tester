summary: This paper presents a conditional diffusion model for generating images with three-dimensional object placement, disentangled representation of global stylistic semantics, depth disentanglement training for identifying absolute positions of unseen objects and soft guidance for imposing global semantics onto targeted regions. The framework, Compose and Conquer, allows perception of objects at varying depths and offers a versatile way to generate localized objects with different global semantics. ...
