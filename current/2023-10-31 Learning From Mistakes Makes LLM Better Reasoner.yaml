summary: Large language models (LLMs) recently exhibited remarkable reasoning\ncapabilities on solving math problems. To further improve this capability, this\nwork proposes Learning from Mistakes (LeMa), akin to human learning processes.\nConsider a human student who failed to solve a math problem, he will learn from\nwhat mistake he has made and how to correct it. Mimicking this error-driven\nlearning process, LeMa fine-tunes LLMs on mistake-correction data pairs\ngenerated by GPT-4. Specifically, we first collect inaccurate reasoning paths\nfrom various LLMs and then employ GPT-4 as a \"corrector\" to (1) identify the\nmistake step, (2) explain the reason for the mistake, and (3) correct the\nmistake and generate the final answer. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of LeMa: across five backbone LLMs and two mathematical reasoning\ntasks, LeMa consistently improves the performance compared with fine-tuning on\nCoT data alone. Impressively, LeMa can also benefit specialized LLMs such as\nWizardMath and MetaMath, achieving 85.4% pass@1 accuracy on GSM8K and 27.1% on\nMATH. This surpasses the SOTA performance achieved by non-execution open-source\nmodels on these challenging tasks. Our code, data and models will be publicly\navailable at https://github.com/microsoft/CodeT.
