summary: 'The paper proposes a method called Weight Averaged Reward Models (WARM) to address the challenge of reward hacking in LLMs fine-tuned through reinforcement learning (RLHF). WARM addresses two primary challenges: distribution shifts and inconsistencies in human preferences. The method involves fine-tuning multiple RMs and averaging their weights, which maintains linear mode connectivity and improves efficiency over traditional ensembling methods. Experiments on summarization tasks show that WARM ...'
