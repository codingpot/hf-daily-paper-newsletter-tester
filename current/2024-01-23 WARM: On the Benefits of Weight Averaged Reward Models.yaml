summary: The paper proposes a solution, called Weight Averaged Reward Models (WARM), to mitigate reward hacking in large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RLHF). The approach involves fine-tuning multiple RMs and then averaging their weights, which follows the observation that fine-tuned weights remain linearly mode connected when sharing the same pre-training. Experiments on summarization tasks show that WARM improves the overall quality and alignment of LLM predictions....
