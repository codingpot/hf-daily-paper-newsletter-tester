summary: This paper introduces Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models that are built on the backbone of Diffusion Transformers (DiT). The interpolant framework allows for a flexible study of design choices impacting generative models with dynamical transport. SiT surpasses DiT on the conditional ImageNet benchmark, and achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 by exploring different diffusion coefficients....
