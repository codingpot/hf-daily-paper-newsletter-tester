summary: This paper presents Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models that improves upon the Diffusion Transformers (DiT) by utilizing an interpolant framework for more flexible distribution connections. SiT outperforms DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark while using the same backbone, number of parameters, and GFLOPs. The SiT model achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 by exploring various diffusion coefficients that can be tuned independently from learning....
