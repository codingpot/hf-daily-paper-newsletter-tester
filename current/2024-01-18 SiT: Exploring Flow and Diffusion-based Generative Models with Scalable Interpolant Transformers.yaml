summary: The paper introduces the concept of Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models that are based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT allows for more flexibility in connecting two distributions than standard diffusion models. By carefully introducing various design choices, SiT outperforms DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark and achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06....
