summary: Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT) is proposed as a generative model built on the backbone of Diffusion Transformers. SiT uses an interpolant framework that allows for the modular study of design choices affecting generative models built on dynamical transport. SiT outperforms DiT uniformly across model sizes on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark and achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 with carefully introduced ingredients and tuned diffusion coefficients....
