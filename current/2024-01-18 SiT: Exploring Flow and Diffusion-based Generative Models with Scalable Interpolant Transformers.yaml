summary: This paper proposes Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which allows for a modular study of various design choices impacting generative models built on dynamical transport. SiT surpasses DiT on the conditional ImageNet benchmark and achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 by exploring various diffusion coefficients....
