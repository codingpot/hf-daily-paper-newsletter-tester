summary: SiT (Scalable Interpolant Transformers) is a generative model that improves upon the Diffusion Transformers (DiT) model by exploring flow and diffusion-based models through a modular study of design choices. This includes using discrete vs. continuous time learning, choosing an objective function, deciding on the interpolant, and using a deterministic or stochastic sampler. By carefully introducing these ingredients, SiT surpasses DiT on a conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark with similar back...
