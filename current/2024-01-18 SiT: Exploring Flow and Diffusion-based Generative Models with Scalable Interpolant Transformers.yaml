summary: Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT) is a family of generative models built on the backbone of Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT uses an interpolant framework that allows for connecting two distributions in a more flexible way than standard diffusion models. This modular study explores various design choices that impact generative models built on dynamical transport such as using discrete vs. continuous time learning, the objective for the model to learn, choosing the interpolant connecting t...
