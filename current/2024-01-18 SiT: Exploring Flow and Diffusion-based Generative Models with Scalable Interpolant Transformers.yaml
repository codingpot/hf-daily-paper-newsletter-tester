summary: Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT) is a generative model family that improves on Diffusion Transformers (DiT) by incorporating an interpolant framework for more flexible distribution connections. SiT outperforms DiT across all model sizes on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, using the same backbone, number of parameters, and GFLOPs, and achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 with tuned diffusion coefficients....
