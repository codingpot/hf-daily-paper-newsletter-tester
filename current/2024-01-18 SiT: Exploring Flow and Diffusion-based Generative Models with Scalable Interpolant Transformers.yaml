summary: This paper presents Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models built on the backbone of Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT allows for a modular study of design choices impacting generative models built on dynamical transport, such as using discrete vs. continuous time learning, deciding the objective for the model, choosing the interpolant, and deploying a deterministic or stochastic sampler. SiT outperforms DiT uniformly across model sizes on the conditional ImageNet ...
