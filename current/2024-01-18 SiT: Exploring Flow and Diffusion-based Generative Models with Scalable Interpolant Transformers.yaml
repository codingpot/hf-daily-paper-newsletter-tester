summary: This paper introduces Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models that improve upon Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT allows for a modular study of design choices impacting generative models, including learning in discrete or continuous time, choice of objective, interpolant, and sampler. SiT outperforms DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark with the same backbone, number of parameters, and GFLOPs. By tuning diffusion coefficients, SiT achieves an FID-50K s...
