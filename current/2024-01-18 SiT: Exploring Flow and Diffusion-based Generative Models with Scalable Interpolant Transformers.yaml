summary: This paper introduces Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models that builds upon Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT provides more flexibility in connecting two distributions than standard diffusion models. The authors conduct a modular study of various design choices that impact generative models built on dynamical transport, including the use of discrete vs. continuous time learning, choosing the objective, the interpolant, and the sampler. SiT outperforms DiT on the...
