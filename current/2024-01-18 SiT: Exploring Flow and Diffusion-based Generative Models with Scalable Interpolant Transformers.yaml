summary: A family of generative models using Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a modular framework for studying various design choices impacting generative models built on dynamical transport. It improves over Diffusion Transformers (DiT) on conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, achieving an FID-50K score of 2.06 by carefully introducing design ingredients and exploring various diffusion coefficients....
