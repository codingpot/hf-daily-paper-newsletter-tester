summary: The paper presents Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative
  models that build on Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT allows for a more flexible
  connection between two distributions, enabling a modular study of design choices.
  SiT surpasses DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, and achieves an
  FID-50K score of 2.06 by exploring various diffusion coefficients....
