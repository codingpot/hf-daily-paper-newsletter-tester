summary: This paper presents Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT explores various design choices in generative models, including using discrete vs. continuous time learning, choosing the objective, interpolant, and sampler. SiT surpasses DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, using the same backbone, number of parameters, and GFLOPs. With tunable diffusion coefficients, SiT achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06....
