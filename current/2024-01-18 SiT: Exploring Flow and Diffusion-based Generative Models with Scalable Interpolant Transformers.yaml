summary: This paper introduces Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models that extend Diffusion Transformers (DiT). SiT allows for more flexible design choices in generative models, such as discrete vs. continuous time learning, and deterministic vs. stochastic samplers. SiT surpasses DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, and achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06....
