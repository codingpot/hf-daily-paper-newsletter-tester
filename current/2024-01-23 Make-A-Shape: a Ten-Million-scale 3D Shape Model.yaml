summary: This paper introduces Make-A-Shape, a new 3D generative model for efficient training on a vast scale using a wavelet-tree representation. The representation is made generatable by a diffusion model and trained by a subband adaptive strategy. The model is also extended to be controlled by additional input conditions for diverse applications, such as unconditional generation, shape completion, and conditional generation on various modalities. The approach delivers high-quality results in just a fe...
