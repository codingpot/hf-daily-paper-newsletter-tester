summary: This paper proposes a new 3D generative model called Make-A-Shape that uses a wavelet-tree representation and a diffusion model to efficiently generate high-quality shapes using a vast dataset of 10 million publicly-available shapes. The model can also generate shapes from various modalities and outperforms previous models in terms of quality and speed....
