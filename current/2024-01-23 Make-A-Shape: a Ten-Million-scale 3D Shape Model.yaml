summary: Make-A-Shape is a 3D generative model that utilizes a wavelet-tree representation and diffusion model to efficiently generate shapes utilizing 10 million publicly available shapes. This model is capable of generating shapes from various modalities, and the authors demonstrate various applications such as unconditional generation, shape completion, and conditional generation. This model not only outperforms the state of the art in generating high-quality results but also does so efficiently, ofte...
