summary: This paper introduces Make-A-Shape, a 3D generative model capable of utilizing 10 million public shapes for efficient training. It employs a wavelet-tree representation for compact encoding and a diffusion model for generating shapes. The model can generate shapes from various modalities such as images, point clouds, and low-resolution voxels. It outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of quality and efficiency, generating shapes in seconds....
