summary: This paper proposes an efficient diffusion-based approach for text-to-video super-resolution tuning, leveraging the learned capacity of a pixel level image diffusion model to capture spatial information for video generation. The approach designs an efficient architecture by inflating the weightings of the text-to-image SR model and includes a temporal adapter to ensure temporal coherence across video frames. Empirical evaluation on the Shutterstock video dataset demonstrates good visual quality ...
