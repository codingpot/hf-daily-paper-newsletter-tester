summary: This paper proposes an efficient diffusion-based text-to-video super-resolution
  tuning approach that leverages the readily learned capacity of a pixel-level image
  diffusion model to capture spatial information for video generation. The authors
  design an efficient architecture by inflating the weightings of the text-to-image
  SR model into their video generation framework and incorporate a temporal adapter
  to ensure temporal coherence across video frames. Empirical evaluation on the Shutterstock
