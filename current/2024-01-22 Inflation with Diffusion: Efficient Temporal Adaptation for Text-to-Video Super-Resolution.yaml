summary: This paper proposes an efficient diffusion-based text-to-video super-resolution tuning approach that leverages the readily learned capacity of a pixel-level image diffusion model to capture spatial information for video generation. The authors design an efficient architecture by inflating the weightings of the text-to-image SR model into their video generation framework and incorporate a temporal adapter to ensure temporal coherence across video frames. Empirical evaluation on the Shutterstock v...
