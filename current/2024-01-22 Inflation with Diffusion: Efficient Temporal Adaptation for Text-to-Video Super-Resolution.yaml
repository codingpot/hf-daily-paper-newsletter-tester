summary: This paper proposes an efficient diffusion-based approach for text-to-video
  super-resolution tuning, leveraging the learned capacity of a pixel level image
  diffusion model to capture spatial information for video generation. The approach
  designs an efficient architecture by inflating the weightings of the text-to-image
  SR model and includes a temporal adapter to ensure temporal coherence across video
  frames. Empirical evaluation on the Shutterstock video dataset demonstrates good
  visual quality ...
