summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that transfers relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories. The method is designed to democratize texture creation by enabling the transfer of detailed, intricate textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects with only a few casually captured images. Personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD) draws inspiration from recent advancements in diffuse mod...
