summary: TextureDreamer is a new image-guided texture synthesis method that can transfer relightable textures from a few input images to target 3D shapes across different categories. The method uses personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD) to extract texture information, synthesize detailed appearances, and guide explicit geometry with ControlNet. This method surpasses the visual quality of previous state-of-the-art methods and has the potential to democratize texture creation....
