summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that transfers relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories using personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD). It potentially democratizes texture creation by transferring highly detailed, intricate textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects with only a few casually captured images. The method improves texture quality and outperforms previous state...
