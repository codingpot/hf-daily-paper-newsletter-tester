summary: The paper proposes TextureDreamer, a novel image-guided texture synthesis method to transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories. The method, inspired by recent advancements in diffusion models, uses personalized geometry-aware score distillation to improve texture quality. The integration of this method with essential modifications outperforms the visual quality of previous state-of-the-art....
