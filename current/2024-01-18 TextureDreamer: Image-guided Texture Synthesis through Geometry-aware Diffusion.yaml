summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that can transfer high-quality and intricate textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects using only a few casually captured images. The core idea, personalized geometry-aware score distillation, improves texture quality by integrating and modifying personalized modeling, variational score distillation, and explicit geometry guidance with ControlNet. Experiments show that TextureDreamer surpasses the visual quality of ...
