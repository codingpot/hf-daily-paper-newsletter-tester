summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that can transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories. Unlike classical methods, TextureDreamer requires only a few casually captured images and is not confined to category-specific shapes. TextureDreamer uses personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD) to extract texture information, synthesize detailed appearance, and guide explicit geometry. The method...
