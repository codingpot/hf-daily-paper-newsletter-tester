summary: This paper presents TextureDreamer, a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that can transfer relightable textures from a few input images to target 3D shapes across various categories. Unlike classical and learning-based methods, TextureDreamer can transfer highly detailed, intricate textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects with only a few casually captured images. The method's core idea is personalized geometry-aware score distillation, which integrates and modifies rec...
