summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that can transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across various categories without the need for densely sampled views or accurately aligned geometry. The method, which draws inspiration from recent advancements in diffuse models, can significantly improve texture quality and democratize texture creation. Experiments on real images across different categories show that TextureDreamer yiel...
