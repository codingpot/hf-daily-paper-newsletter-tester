summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that can
  transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes
  across arbitrary categories. It is inspired by recent advancements in diffusion
  models and uses personalized geometry-aware score distillation to improve texture
  quality. TextureDreamer has the potential to significantly democratize texture creation
  as it can transfer highly detailed textures from real-world environments to arbitrary
  objec...
