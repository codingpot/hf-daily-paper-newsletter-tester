summary: TextureDreamer is a new method for transferring relightable textures from a small number of input images (3-5) to target 3D shapes across various categories. It uses personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD), which incorporates recent advancements in diffusion models, to improve texture quality. Experiments on real images across different categories show that TextureDreamer outperforms previous state-of-the-art in terms of visual quality, potentially democratizing texture creation....
