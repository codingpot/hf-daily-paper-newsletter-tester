summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that can transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories, democratizing texture creation. The method, Personalized Geometry-aware Score Distillation (PGSD), integrates recent advancements in diffuse models and improves texture quality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in experiments on real images across different categories....
