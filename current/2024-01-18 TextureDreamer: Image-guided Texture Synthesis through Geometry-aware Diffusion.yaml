summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that transfers
  relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across
  arbitrary categories. The method is designed to democratize texture creation by
  enabling the transfer of detailed, intricate textures from real-world environments
  to arbitrary objects with only a few casually captured images. Personalized geometry-aware
  score distillation (PGSD) draws inspiration from recent advancements in diffuse
