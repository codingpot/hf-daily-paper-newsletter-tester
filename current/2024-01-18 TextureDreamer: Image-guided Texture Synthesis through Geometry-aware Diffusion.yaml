summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that uses geometry-aware diffusion to transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories. The method, Personalized Geometry-aware Score Distillation (PGSD), improves texture quality by integrating advancements in diffuse models and surpasses the visual quality of previous state-of-the-art methods....
