summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that transfers
  relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across
  different categories using personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD)
  based on recent advancements in diffuse models. It improves texture quality and
  surpasses previous state-of-the-art visual quality on real images spanning different
  categories....
