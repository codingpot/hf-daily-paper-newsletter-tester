summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that can transfer detailed, intricate textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects using only a few casually captured images. It utilizes personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD) and other modifications, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods in transferring highly realistic, semantic meaningful textures to arbitrary objects across different categories....
