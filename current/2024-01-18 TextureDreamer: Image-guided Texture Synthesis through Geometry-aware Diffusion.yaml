summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that uses geometry-aware diffusion models to transfer relightable textures from a few input images to target 3D shapes across different categories. Unlike traditional and learning-based methods, TextureDreamer can transfer complex textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects, potentially democratizing texture creation. Its main technology is Personalized Geometry-aware Score Distillation (PGSD), which combines personal...
