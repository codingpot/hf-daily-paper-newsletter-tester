summary: TextureDreamer is a new method for image-guided texture synthesis that can transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across different categories. Unlike classical and learning-based methods, TextureDreamer requires only a few casually captured images and can generate highly detailed, intricate textures. The core idea behind TextureDreamer is personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD), which incorporates recent advancements in diffuse models,...
