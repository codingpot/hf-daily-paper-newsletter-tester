summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that can transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images (3 to 5) to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories. It is able to create highly detailed and intricate textures from real-world environments to arbitrary objects, potentially democratizing texture creation. The core idea, Personalized Geometry-aware Score Distillation, draws inspiration from recent advancements in diffusion models and substantially impr...
