summary: The paper proposes DITTO, a framework for controlling pre-trained text-to-music diffusion models at inference-time through optimizing initial noise latents. It can be used for a wide range of applications including inpainting, outpainting, and looping, as well as intensity, melody, and musical structure control, without fine-tuning the underlying model. DITTO achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks, including controllability, audio quality, and computational efficiency, thus of...
