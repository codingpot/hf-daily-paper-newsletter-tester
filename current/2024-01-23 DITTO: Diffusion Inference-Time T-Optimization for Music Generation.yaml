summary: The paper proposes a framework called DITTO for controlling pre-trained text-to-music
  diffusion models at inference time by optimizing initial noise latents. This approach
  can be used for a wide range of music generation applications such as inpainting,
  outpainting, looping, intensity, melody, and musical structure control without fine-tuning
  the underlying model. DITTO achieves state-of-the-art performance on most tasks
  compared to related methods, offering flexibility, audio quality, and effic...
