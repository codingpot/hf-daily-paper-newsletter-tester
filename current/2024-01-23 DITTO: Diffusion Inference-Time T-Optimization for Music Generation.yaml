summary: The paper proposes a new method called DITTO that can control pre-trained
  text-to-music diffusion models at inference-time. It uses optimizing initial noise
  latents and a differentiable feature matching loss to achieve a target (stylized)
  output. DITTO demonstrates a wide-range of applications for music generation and
  is more efficient than comparable approaches, making it a promising tool for high-quality,
  flexible control of diffusion models....
