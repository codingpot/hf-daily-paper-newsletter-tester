summary: This paper introduces DITTO, a framework for controlling pre-trained music generators at inference-time by optimizing initial noise latents. It can be used for a wide range of music generation tasks without requiring fine-tuning of the underlying model, and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to related methods....
