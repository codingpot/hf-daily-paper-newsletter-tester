summary: This paper introduces DITTO, a framework for controlling pre-trained music
  generators at inference-time by optimizing initial noise latents. It can be used
  for a wide range of music generation tasks without requiring fine-tuning of the
  underlying model, and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to related
  methods....
