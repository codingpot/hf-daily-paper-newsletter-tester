summary: The paper proposes a new method called DITTO that can control pre-trained text-to-music diffusion models at inference-time. It uses optimizing initial noise latents and a differentiable feature matching loss to achieve a target (stylized) output. DITTO demonstrates a wide-range of applications for music generation and is more efficient than comparable approaches, making it a promising tool for high-quality, flexible control of diffusion models....
