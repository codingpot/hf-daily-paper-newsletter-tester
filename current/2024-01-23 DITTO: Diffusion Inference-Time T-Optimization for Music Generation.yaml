summary: The paper proposes DITTO, a framework for controlling pre-trained text-to-music
  diffusion models at inference-time through optimizing initial noise latents. It
  can be used for a wide range of applications including inpainting, outpainting,
  and looping, as well as intensity, melody, and musical structure control, without
  fine-tuning the underlying model. DITTO achieves state-of-the-art performance on
  nearly all tasks, including controllability, audio quality, and computational efficiency,
  thus of...
