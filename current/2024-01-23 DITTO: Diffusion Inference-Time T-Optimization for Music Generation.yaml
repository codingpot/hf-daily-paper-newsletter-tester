summary: DITTO is a general-purpose framework that allows for controlling pre-trained text-to-music diffusion models at inference-time via optimizing initial noise latents. It can be used to optimize through any differentiable feature matching loss to achieve a target output and has a wide range of applications for music generation, including inpainting, outpainting, and looping as well as intensity, melody, and musical structure control. It outperforms comparable approaches in controllability, audio qua...
