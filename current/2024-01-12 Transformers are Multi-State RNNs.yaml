summary: This paper demonstrates that transformers, which are traditionally seen as different from recurrent neural networks (RNNs), can be conceptualized as multi-state RNNs. The authors show that pretrained transformers can be converted into finite multi-state RNNs by fixing the size of their hidden state. They introduce a novel policy, TOVA, for caching the output of the multi-state RNN, which outperforms other baseline policies while using fewer resources. The study suggests that transformers often b...
