summary: This paper argues that decoder-only transformers can be conceptualized as infinite multi-state RNNs with unlimited hidden state size, and that pretrained transformers can be converted into finite multi-state RNNs by fixing their hidden state size. It introduces a simple compression policy, TOVA, that outperforms other baseline policies in long-range tasks while using only a small fraction of the original cache size. The results suggest that transformer models often behave like RNNs and that this...
