summary: This paper presents ICON, an optimization procedure for training NeRFs from 2D video frames that eliminates the need for accurate initial camera poses. ICON estimates initial camera poses from smooth motion and uses confidence, an adaptive measure of model quality, to dynamically reweight gradients. By iteratively refining both NeRF and pose, ICON outperforms methods using SfM pose in CO3D and HO3D....
