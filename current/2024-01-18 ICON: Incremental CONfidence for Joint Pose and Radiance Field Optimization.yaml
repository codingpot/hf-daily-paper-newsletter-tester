summary: Incremental CONfidence (ICON) is an optimization procedure for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for Novel View Synthesis from 2D video frames without requiring accurate camera pose initialization. ICON estimates initial camera pose using smooth motion and introduces "confidence" to dynamically reweight gradients. It relies on high-confidence poses to learn NeRF and high-confidence 3D structure to learn poses, achieving superior performance versus methods using SfM pose...
