summary: The paper presents an optimization procedure called ICON which is used to train NeRF models from 2D video frames without requiring initial poses. ICON uses smooth camera motion to estimate initial poses and introduces 'confidence' as an adaptive measure of model quality to dynamically reweight gradients. ICON achieves better performance in CO3D and HO3D compared to methods that use SfM pose....
