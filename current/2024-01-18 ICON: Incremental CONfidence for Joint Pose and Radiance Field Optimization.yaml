summary: The paper presents Incremental CONfidence (ICON), an optimization procedure for training NeRFs from 2D video frames that removes the requirement for pose initialization. ICON estimates initial guess for poses assuming smooth camera motion and introduces confidence, an adaptive measure of model quality used to dynamically reweight gradients. It relies on high-confidence poses to learn NeRF and high-confidence 3D structure to learn poses. ICON achieves superior performance in CO3D and HO3D versus ...
