summary: This paper presents ICON, an optimization procedure for training Neural Radiance Fields from 2D video frames without the requirement for initial camera pose. ICON estimates initial guesses for poses based on smooth camera motion and introduces 'confidence', an adaptive measure of model quality that dynamically reweights gradients. ICON learns NeRF from high-confidence poses and uses high-confidence 3D structure to learn poses. The method outperforms other methods that rely on Structure-from-Moti...
