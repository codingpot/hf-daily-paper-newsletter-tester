summary: The paper proposes ICON (Incremental CONfidence) for training NeRFs (Neural Radiance Fields) from 2D video frames, without relying on accurate camera pose for each input view. ICON estimates initial guesses for poses based on smooth camera motion and uses a measure of model quality (confidence) to dynamically reweight gradients for improving model training. ICON achieves superior performance on CO3D and HO3D datasets compared to methods that require SfM (Structure-from-Motion) pose initializatio...
