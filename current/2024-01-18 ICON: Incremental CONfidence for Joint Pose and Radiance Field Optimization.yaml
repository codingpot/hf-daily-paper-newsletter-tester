summary: This paper presents ICON, an optimization procedure for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) from 2D video frames without requiring accurate camera pose for each input view. ICON estimates initial guesses for poses using smooth camera motion and uses adaptive measures of model quality to guide the optimization. By iteratively learning NeRF and poses, ICON achieves superior performance in novel view synthesis compared to methods that use Structure-from-Motion pose initialization....
