summary: ICON is an optimization procedure for training NeRFs from 2D video frames which removes the requirement for pose initialization. ICON uses smooth camera motion to estimate initial poses and introduces a measure of confidence to dynamically reweight gradients, which allows for superior performance compared to methods that use SfM pose....
