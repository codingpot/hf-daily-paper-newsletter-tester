summary: 'ICON: Incremental CONfidence is an optimization procedure for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) from 2D video frames, without requiring accurate camera poses for each input view. ICON estimates initial poses based on smooth camera motion and uses ''confidence'' to dynamically reweight gradients. It relies on high-confidence poses and 3D structure to learn NeRF, achieving superior performance compared to methods requiring SfM pose....'
