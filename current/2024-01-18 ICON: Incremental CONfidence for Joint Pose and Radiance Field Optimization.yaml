summary: This paper introduces ICON, an optimization procedure for training NeRFs from 2D video frames without using prior pose initialization. ICON estimates initial poses based on smooth camera motion and uses an adaptive measure of model quality called "confidence" to reweight gradients. It learns NeRF using high-confidence poses and 3D structure, leading to improved performance on CO3D and HO3D datasets compared to methods using SfM pose....
