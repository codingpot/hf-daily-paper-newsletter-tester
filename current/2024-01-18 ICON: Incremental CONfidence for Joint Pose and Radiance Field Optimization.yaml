summary: The paper presents Incremental CONfidence (ICON), an optimization procedure
  for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) from 2D video frames, without the requirement
  for pose initialization. ICON estimates initial guesses for poses assuming smooth
  camera motion and uses an adaptive measure of model quality, called confidence,
  to dynamically reweight gradients. The method relies on high-confidence poses to
  learn NeRF and high-confidence 3D structure to learn poses, and achieves superior
  performanc...
