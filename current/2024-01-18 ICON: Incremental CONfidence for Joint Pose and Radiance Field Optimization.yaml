summary: This paper presents ICON, an optimization procedure for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) from 2D video frames without relying on accurate camera pose initialization. ICON estimates initial poses based on smooth camera motion and uses an adaptive measure of model quality called 'confidence' to reweight gradients. ICON learns NeRF from high-confidence poses and learns poses from high-confidence 3D structure. It outperforms methods that use Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pose in CO3D and HO3D da...
