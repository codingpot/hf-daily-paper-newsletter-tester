summary: The paper presents an optimization procedure called ICON for training NeRF models from 2D video frames. The method removes the requirement for pose initialization and uses smooth camera motion to estimate initial poses. The method also introduces an adaptive measure of model quality called 'confidence' to dynamically reweight gradients, relying on high-confidence poses to learn NeRF and high-confidence 3D structure to learn poses. ICON achieves superior performance without prior pose initializat...
