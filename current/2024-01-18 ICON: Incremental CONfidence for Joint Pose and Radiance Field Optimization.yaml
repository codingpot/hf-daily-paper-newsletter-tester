summary: ICON is an optimization procedure for training NeRFs from 2D video frames. It relies on smooth camera motion to estimate initial guess for poses and introduces 'confidence' as an adaptive measure to reweight gradients. By leveraging high-confidence poses and 3D structure, ICON achieves better performance in CO3D and HO3D without prior pose initialization compared to methods using SfM pose....
