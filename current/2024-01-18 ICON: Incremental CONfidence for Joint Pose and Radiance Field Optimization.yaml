summary: The paper proposes ICON, an optimization procedure for NeRF training from 2D video frames, that eliminates the need for accurate initial camera poses. ICON uses smooth camera motion to estimate initial poses and introduces conference to adaptively weigh the gradients. The method shows improved performance in CO3D and HO3D datasets compared to methods using SfM pose....
