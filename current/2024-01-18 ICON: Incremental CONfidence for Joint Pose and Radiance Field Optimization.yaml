summary: The paper introduces an optimization procedure for training NeRFs from 2D video frames called Incremental CONfidence (ICON). ICON estimates initial guesses for poses assuming smooth camera motion and uses an adaptive measure of model quality to dynamically reweight gradients. It relies on high-confidence poses to learn NeRF and high-confidence 3D structure to learn poses. ICON achieves superior performance in CO3D and HO3D datasets without prior pose initialization....
