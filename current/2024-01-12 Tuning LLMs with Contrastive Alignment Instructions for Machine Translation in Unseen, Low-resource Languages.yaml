summary: This paper introduces contrastive alignment instructions (AlignInstruct) which helps improve machine translation on large language models, particularly in low-resource languages and unseen languages. The authors fine-tuned the BLOOMZ models and found that AlignInstruct improved translation quality, outperforming generative counterparts, and improved performance in 30 zero-shot directions....
