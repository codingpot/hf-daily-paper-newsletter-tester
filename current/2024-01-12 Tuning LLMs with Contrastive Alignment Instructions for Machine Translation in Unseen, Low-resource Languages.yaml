summary: This paper proposes contrastive alignment instructions (AlignInstruct) to improve machine translation for unseen and low-resource languages in large language models (LLMs). AlignInstruct uses a cross-lingual discriminator built from statistical word alignments to provide stronger cross-lingual supervision. The results showed that LLMs can effectively translate unseen languages, and AlignInstruct improved translation quality and performance in zero-shot directions....
