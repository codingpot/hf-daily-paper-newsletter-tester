summary: This paper introduces a memory-efficient method to scale graph-based learned simulators for handling real world scenes with hundreds of objects. The method presents a perceptual interface using editable NeRFs to convert real world scenes into a structured representation for graph network simulators. The learned simulators in synthetic environments can be applied to real world scenes captured from multiple camera angles with the proposed method's accuracy while using less memory than previous gra...
