summary: This paper presents a method to scale and apply learned graph network simulators
  to real world scenes involving multiple objects with complex 3D shapes. The paper
  introduces a memory-efficient simulation model and a perceptual interface in the
  form of editable NeRFs, which can convert real-world scenes into a structured representation
  that can be processed by graph network simulators. The method uses less memory than
  previous graph-based simulators while maintaining accuracy and is able to apply...
