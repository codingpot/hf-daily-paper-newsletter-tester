summary: The paper presents a method to scale and apply graph-based learned simulators to real world scenes involving hundreds of complex objects. The method significantly reduces memory requirements and uses a perceptual interface in the form of editable NeRFs to convert real-world scenes into a structured representation to be processed by the graph network simulator. The approach retains the accuracy of previous graph-based simulators and can be applied to real-world scenes captured from multiple camer...
