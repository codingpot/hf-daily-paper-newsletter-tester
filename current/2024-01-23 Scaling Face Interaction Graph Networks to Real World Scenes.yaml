summary: The paper presents a method to scale and apply graph-based learned simulators
  to real world scenes involving hundreds of complex objects. The method significantly
  reduces memory requirements and uses a perceptual interface in the form of editable
  NeRFs to convert real-world scenes into a structured representation to be processed
  by the graph network simulator. The approach retains the accuracy of previous graph-based
  simulators and can be applied to real-world scenes captured from multiple camer...
