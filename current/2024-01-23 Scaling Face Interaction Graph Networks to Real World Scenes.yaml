summary: 'Accurately simulating real world object dynamics is essential for various
  applications such as robotics, engineering, graphics, and design. To better capture
  complex real dynamics such as contact and friction, learned simulators based on
  graph networks have recently shown great promise. However, applying these learned
  simulators to real scenes comes with two major challenges: first, scaling learned
  simulators to handle the complexity of real world scenes which can involve hundreds
  of objects eac...'
