summary: This paper presents a method to scale and apply learned graph network simulators to real world scenes involving multiple objects with complex 3D shapes. The paper introduces a memory-efficient simulation model and a perceptual interface in the form of editable NeRFs, which can convert real-world scenes into a structured representation that can be processed by graph network simulators. The method uses less memory than previous graph-based simulators while maintaining accuracy and is able to apply...
