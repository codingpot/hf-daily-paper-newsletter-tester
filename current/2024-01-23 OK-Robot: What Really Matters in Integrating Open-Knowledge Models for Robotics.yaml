summary: The paper introduces OK-Robot, a new open-knowledge-based robotics framework that combines vision-language models, navigation primitives, and grasping primitives for pick-and-drop operations without training. Evaluated in 10 real-world home environments, OK-Robot achieves a new state-of-the-art for open-ended mobile manipulation with a success rate of 58.5% and highlights the importance of nuanced details when combining open knowledge systems with robotic modules. Videos of the experiments are a...
