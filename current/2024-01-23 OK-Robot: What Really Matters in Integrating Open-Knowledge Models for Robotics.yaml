summary: The abstract introduces OK-Robot, a new robotics framework that combines
  vision, language, and grasping models for pick-and-drop operations without requiring
  any training. The framework has a 58.5% success rate in open-ended pick-and-drop
  tasks, outperforming prior work by nearly 1.8x in open-vocabulary mobile manipulation.
  The experiments show the importance of combining Open Knowledge systems with robotic
  modules....
