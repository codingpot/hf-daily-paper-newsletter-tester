summary: This paper presents OK-Robot, a new Open Knowledge-based robotics framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for object detection, navigation primitives for movement, and grasping primitives for object manipulation. The framework enables pick-and-drop operations without training and achieves a new state-of-the-art in Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation (OVMM) with a ~58.5% success rate in real-world home environments. The paper emphasizes the importance of nuanced details when combi...
