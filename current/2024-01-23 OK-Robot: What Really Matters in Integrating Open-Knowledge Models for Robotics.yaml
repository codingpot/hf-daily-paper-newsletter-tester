summary: The paper proposes a new robotics framework called OK-Robot, which combines
  vision-language models, navigation primitives, and grasping primitives to perform
  pick-and-drop operations without training. The results show that OK-Robot achieves
  a 58.5% success rate in open-ended pick-and-drop tasks, and the most important insight
  gained is the critical role of nuanced details in combining Open Knowledge systems
  like VLMs with robotic modules....
