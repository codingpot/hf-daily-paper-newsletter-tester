summary: The paper proposes a new robotics framework called OK-Robot, which combines vision-language models, navigation primitives, and grasping primitives to perform pick-and-drop operations without training. The results show that OK-Robot achieves a 58.5% success rate in open-ended pick-and-drop tasks, and the most important insight gained is the critical role of nuanced details in combining Open Knowledge systems like VLMs with robotic modules....
