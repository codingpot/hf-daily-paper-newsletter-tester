summary: The paper presents OK-Robot, a new Open Knowledge-based robotics framework that integrates vision, language, navigation, and grasping models for pick-and-drop operations without training. The framework achieves a new state-of-the-art in Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation with nearly 1.8x the performance of prior work. The paper highlights the importance of nuanced details when combining Open Knowledge systems with robotic modules. Videos of the experiments are available on the project's website...
