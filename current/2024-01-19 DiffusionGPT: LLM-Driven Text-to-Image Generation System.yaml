summary: DiffusionGPT is a unified text-to-image generation system that leverages LLMs to accommodate various types of prompts and integrate domain-expert models. It constructs domain-specific trees for various generative models based on prior knowledge and uses Trees-of-Thought to guide the selection of an appropriate model, relaxing input constraints and ensuring exceptional performance across diverse domains. The model selection process is further enhanced with human feedback through Advantage Databas...
