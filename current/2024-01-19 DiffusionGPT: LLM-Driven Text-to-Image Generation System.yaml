summary: This paper proposes DiffusionGPT, a unified text-to-image generation system that leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to accommodate a variety of prompts and integrate domain-expert models. DiffusionGPT constructs domain-specific Trees for generative models based on prior knowledge and uses the LLM to parse prompts and select an appropriate model, thereby relaxing input constraints and achieving exceptional performance across diverse domains. The model selection process is also enriched with hu...
