summary: This paper proposes DiffusionGPT, a unified text-to-image generation system
  that leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to accommodate a variety of prompts and
  integrate domain-expert models. DiffusionGPT constructs domain-specific Trees for
  generative models based on prior knowledge and uses the LLM to parse prompts and
  select an appropriate model, thereby relaxing input constraints and achieving exceptional
  performance across diverse domains. The model selection process is also enriched
  with hu...
