summary: This paper presents EmerDiff, a framework for extracting fine-grained semantic information from pre-trained diffusion models for image segmentation. It leverages the semantic knowledge extracted from Stable Diffusion and directly extracts pixel-level semantic relations using spatial correspondences. The results show that the generated segmentation maps are well-delineated, indicating the existence of accurate pixel-level semantic knowledge in diffusion models without additional training....
