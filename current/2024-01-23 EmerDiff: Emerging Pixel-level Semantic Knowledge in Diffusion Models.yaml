summary: This paper explores the potential of pre-trained diffusion models to generate fine-grained segmentation masks without additional training. By leveraging the semantic knowledge extracted from Stable Diffusion, the authors develop a method to construct image-resolution segmentation maps. The framework identifies semantic correspondences between image pixels and spatial locations of low-dimensional feature maps, which are used to generate segmentation maps that are well delineated and capture detai...
