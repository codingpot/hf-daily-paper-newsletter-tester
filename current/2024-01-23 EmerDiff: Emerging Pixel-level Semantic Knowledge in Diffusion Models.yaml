summary: The paper proposes EmerDiff, a method to extract fine-grained semantic knowledge from pre-trained diffusion models for image segmentation. By exploiting the structural information from the generator, EmerDiff generates high-fidelity segmentation maps without additional training. The results demonstrate the existence of pixel-level semantic knowledge in diffusion models....
