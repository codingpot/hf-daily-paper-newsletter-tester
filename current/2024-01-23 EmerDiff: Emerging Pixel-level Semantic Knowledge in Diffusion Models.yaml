summary: The paper proposes a framework to extract fine-grained segmentation maps from pre-trained diffusion models, by identifying semantic correspondences between image pixels and low-dimensional feature maps. This method does not require additional training and produces detailed and accurate segmentation maps, demonstrating the presence of pixel-level semantic knowledge in diffusion models....
