summary: This paper proposes a method for understanding the decision-making process
  of transformer models for video by automatically discovering high-level spatiotemporal
  concepts. The paper introduces the Video Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm
  for unsupervised identification of units of video transformer representations and
  ranking their importance. The resulting concepts are highly interpretable and reveal
  spatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations in unstruct...
