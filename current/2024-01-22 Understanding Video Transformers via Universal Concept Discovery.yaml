summary: This paper presents the first Video Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD)
  algorithm to address the problem of concept-based interpretability of transformer
  representations for videos. The VTCD algorithm is used to unsupervisedly identify
  and rank units of video transformer representations - concepts, revealing spatio-temporal
  reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations in unstructured video models.
  The resulting concepts are highly interpretable and can be used to improve model
  perfor...
