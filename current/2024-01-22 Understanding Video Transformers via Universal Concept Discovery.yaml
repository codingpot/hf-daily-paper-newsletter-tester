summary: This paper presents the first Video Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm to address the problem of concept-based interpretability of transformer representations for videos. The VTCD algorithm is used to unsupervisedly identify and rank units of video transformer representations - concepts, revealing spatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations in unstructured video models. The resulting concepts are highly interpretable and can be used to improve model perfor...
