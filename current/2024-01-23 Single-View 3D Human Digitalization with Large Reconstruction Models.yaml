summary: This paper presents Human-LRM, a single-stage large reconstruction model designed to predict human neural radiance fields (NeRF) from a single image. The model is trained on extensive datasets containing 3D scans and multi-view capture and has the ability to reconstruct human body shapes from occluded images through a conditional triplane diffusion model. Human-LRM outperforms previous methods on several benchmarks....
