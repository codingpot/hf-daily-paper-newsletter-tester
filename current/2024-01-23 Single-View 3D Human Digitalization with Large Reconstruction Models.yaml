summary: This paper presents a large reconstruction model called Human-LRM designed to create 3D NeRF models of humans from a single image. The model is trained using extensive datasets and can handle occlusions by using a conditional triplane diffusion model. Experiments show that Human-LRM outperforms previous methods on several benchmarks....
