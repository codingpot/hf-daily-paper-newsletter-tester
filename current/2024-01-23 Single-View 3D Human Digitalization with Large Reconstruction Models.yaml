summary: This paper presents a large reconstruction model called Human-LRM designed
  to create 3D NeRF models of humans from a single image. The model is trained using
  extensive datasets and can handle occlusions by using a conditional triplane diffusion
  model. Experiments show that Human-LRM outperforms previous methods on several benchmarks....
