summary: This paper presents Human-LRM, a Large Reconstruction Model for predicting human NeRFs from a single image. It demonstrates adaptability in training with extensive datasets and proposes a novel strategy using a conditional triplane diffusion model to enhance applicability for in-the-wild scenarios, especially with occlusions. Human-LRM surpasses previous methods on several benchmarks....
