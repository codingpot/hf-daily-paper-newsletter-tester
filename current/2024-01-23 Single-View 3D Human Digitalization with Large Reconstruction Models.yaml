summary: This paper introduces Human-LRM, a single-stage feed-forward Large Reconstruction
  Model designed to predict human NeRFs from a single image. The model is trained
  using extensive datasets containing 3D scans and multi-view capture and can reconstruct
  the full body human even from occluded images using a conditional triplane diffusion
  model. Extensive experiments show Human-LRM outperforms previous methods on several
  benchmarks....
