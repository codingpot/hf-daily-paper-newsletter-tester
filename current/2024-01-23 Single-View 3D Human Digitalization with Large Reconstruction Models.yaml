summary: This paper presents Human-LRM, a single-stage large reconstruction model
  designed to predict human neural radiance fields (NeRF) from a single image. The
  model is trained on extensive datasets containing 3D scans and multi-view capture
  and has the ability to reconstruct human body shapes from occluded images through
  a conditional triplane diffusion model. Human-LRM outperforms previous methods on
  several benchmarks....
