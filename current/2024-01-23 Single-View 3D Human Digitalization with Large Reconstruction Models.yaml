summary: This paper introduces Human-LRM, a Large Reconstruction Model designed to predict human Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) from a single image. The model is trained using extensive datasets containing 3D scans and multi-view capture, and demonstrates remarkable adaptability. The authors also propose a novel strategy that distills multi-view reconstruction into single-view via a conditional triplane diffusion model, which makes it possible to reconstruct the full body human from an occluded image.
