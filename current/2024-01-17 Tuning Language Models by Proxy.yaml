summary: This paper introduces proxy-tuning, a lightweight decoding-time algorithm that operates on top of black-box language models to achieve the result of directly tuning the model, but by accessing only its prediction over the output vocabulary. The method instead tunes a smaller LM, then applies the difference between the predictions of the small tuned and untuned LMs to shift the original predictions of the base model in the direction of tuning, while retaining the benefits of larger scale pretrain...
