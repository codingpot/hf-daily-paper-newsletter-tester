summary: This paper proposes a large-scale dataset, SceneVerse, and a unified learning framework, GPS, for grounding language in 3D scenes. SceneVerse contains 68K indoor scenes and 2.5M vision-language pairs, which allows for pre-training GPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 3D visual grounding benchmarks and the potential of GPS for 3D vision-language tasks....
