summary: This paper introduces SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, and GPS, a unified pre-training framework for 3D vision-language learning. The dataset and framework address the challenges of complex 3D scenes, scarce data, and lack of a unified learning framework. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of GPS by achieving state-of-the-art performance in existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks and showcases the potential of SceneVerse and GPS in zero-shot transfer experiments for ...
