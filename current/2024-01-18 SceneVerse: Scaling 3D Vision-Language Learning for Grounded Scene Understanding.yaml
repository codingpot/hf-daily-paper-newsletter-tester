summary: 'This paper proposes SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, and a unified learning framework (GPS) for grounded 3D vision-language learning. The dataset and framework address challenges associated with 3D scenes'' complexity, data scarcity, and lack of a unified learning framework. GPS outperforms previous methods and demonstrates potential through zero-shot transfer experiments. Project website: https://scene-verse.github.io....'
