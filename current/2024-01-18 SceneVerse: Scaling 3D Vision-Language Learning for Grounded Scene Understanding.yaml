summary: This paper introduces the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse, and a unified pre-training framework, Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), for 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments. SceneVerse encompasses about 68K 3D indoor scenes and comprises 2.5M vision-language pairs derived from both human annotations and a scalable scene-graph-based generation approach. GPS achieves state-of-the-art performance on all existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks and is eff...
