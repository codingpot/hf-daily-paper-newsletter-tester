summary: The paper addresses challenges in 3D vision-language grounding by introducing the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse, and a unified pre-training framework, GPS. The dataset and framework are shown to be effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks with extensive experiments, and the potential of both is unveiled through zero-shot transfer experiments....
