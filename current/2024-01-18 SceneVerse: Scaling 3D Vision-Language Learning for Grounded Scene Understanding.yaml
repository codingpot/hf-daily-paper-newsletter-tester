summary: The paper presents SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset
  for grounded scene understanding. The dataset, along with a scalable scene-graph-based
  generation approach, addresses challenges in 3D vision-language learning like inherent
  complexity, scarcity of data, and lack of a unified learning framework. A pre-training
  framework, GPS, is introduced for 3D vision-language learning, which achieves state-of-the-art
  performance on existing benchmarks and demonstrates potential in zero-...
