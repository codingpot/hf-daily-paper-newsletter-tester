summary: The paper proposes SceneVerse, the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, and Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), a unified pre-training framework for 3D vision-language learning to tackle the challenges of inherent complexity, data scarcity, and lack of a unified learning framework. Through extensive experiments, the effectiveness of GPS is shown, and the vast potential of SceneVerse and GPS is unveiled through zero-shot transfer experiments in the challenging 3D vision-language ta...
