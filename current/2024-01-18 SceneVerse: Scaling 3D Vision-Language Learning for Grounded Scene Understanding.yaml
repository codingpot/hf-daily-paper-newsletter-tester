summary: 'The paper proposes SceneVerse, the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, and Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), a unified pre-training framework for 3D vision-language learning to address challenges in grounding language in 3D scenes. The dataset and framework showcase state-of-the-art performance in existing benchmarks and contribute to the development of embodied agents. Project website:  <https://scene-verse.github.io>....'
