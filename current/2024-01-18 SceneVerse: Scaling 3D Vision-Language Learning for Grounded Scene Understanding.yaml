summary: 'The paper presents SceneVerse, a large-scale 3D vision-language dataset and the Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS) framework, addressing challenges in 3D scene grounding by systematically upscaling 3D vision-language learning. Experiments show GPS''s effectiveness and potential in achieving state-of-the-art performance and zero-shot transfer in 3D visual grounding tasks. Project website: https://scene-verse.github.io....'
