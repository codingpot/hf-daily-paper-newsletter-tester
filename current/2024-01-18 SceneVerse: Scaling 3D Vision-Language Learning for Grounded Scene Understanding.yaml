summary: This paper introduces SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset encompassing 68K 3D indoor scenes and 2.5M vision-language pairs, derived from human annotations and scalable scene-graph-based generation approach. The paper also presents GPS, a unified pre-training framework for 3D vision-language learning, which effectively addresses the challenges of complexity, data scarcity, and absence of a unified learning framework in 3D vision-language grounding. Experiments demonstrate state...
