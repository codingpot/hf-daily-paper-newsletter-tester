summary: The paper presents SceneVerse, a large-scale 3D vision-language dataset, and a unified pre-training framework called GPS, to address challenges in grounding language in 3D scenes, such as complexity, data scarcity, and lack of a unified learning framework. The dataset and pre-training framework improved the state-of-the-art performance on existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks....
