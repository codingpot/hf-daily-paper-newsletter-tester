summary: 'The paper presents SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, with 68K indoor scenes and 2.5M pairs, and Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), a unified learning framework, to overcome challenges in 3D scene understanding and language grounding. The paper showcases GPS''s effectiveness by achieving SOTA results on 3D visual grounding benchmarks and zero-shot transfer performance in 3D vision-language tasks.
