summary: The paper presents SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset with 68K indoor scenes and 2.5M pairs derived from human annotations and scalable scene-graph-based generation. The paper proposes Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), a unified learning framework for 3D vision-language learning. The framework is effective and achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks, and zero-shot transfer experiments demonstrate its potential in challenging 3D vision-language tasks...
