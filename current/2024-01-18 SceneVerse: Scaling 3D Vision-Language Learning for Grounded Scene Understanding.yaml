summary: The paper introduces the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse, to address the challenges of 3D scene complexity, data scarcity, and a unified learning framework for grounding language in 3D scenes. The paper introduces a new pre-training framework, GPS, for 3D vision-language learning that achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks and demonstrates its potential through zero-shot transfer experiments....
