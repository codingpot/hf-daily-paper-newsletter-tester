summary: 'The paper presents a method for scaling 3D vision-language learning for grounded scene understanding, addressing challenges related to complexity of 3D scenes, data scarcity, and lack of a unified learning framework. The authors introduce the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse, and propose a pre-training framework, GPS, for 3D vision-language learning. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance and transferability to challenging tasks. Project website: https://scene-ve...'
