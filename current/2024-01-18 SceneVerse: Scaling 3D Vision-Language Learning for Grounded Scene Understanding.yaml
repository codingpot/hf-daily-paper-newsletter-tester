summary: The paper presents SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset for grounded scene understanding. The dataset, along with a scalable scene-graph-based generation approach, addresses challenges in 3D vision-language learning like inherent complexity, scarcity of data, and lack of a unified learning framework. A pre-training framework, GPS, is introduced for 3D vision-language learning, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks and demonstrates potential in zero-...
