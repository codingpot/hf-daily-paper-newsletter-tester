summary: The paper presents SceneVerse, the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, which allows for the pre-training of a unified learning framework called GPS (Grounded Pre-training for Scenes) for 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments. The dataset and framework effectively address the challenges faced in grounding language in 3D scenes by enabling upscaled learning, leading to state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks....
