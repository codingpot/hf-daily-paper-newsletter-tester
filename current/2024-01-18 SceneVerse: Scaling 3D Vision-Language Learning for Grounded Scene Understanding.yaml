summary: The paper introduces SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, and GPS, a unified pre-training framework for 3D vision-language learning. The dataset addresses challenges in grounding language in 3D scenes, such as inherent complexity and scarcity of paired data. GPS achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks and shows potential through zero-shot transfer experiments in the challenging 3D vision-language tasks....
