summary: This paper proposes a solution to address the challenges in 3D vision-language grounding, which involves aligning language with the 3D physical environment. The authors introduce SceneVerse, a million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, and a unified learning framework called GPS for grounded 3D vision-language learning. The effectiveness of GPS is demonstrated through extensive experiments, and the vast potential of SceneVerse and GPS is shown through zero-shot transfer experiments in challenging...
