summary: This paper proposes a new training-free text-to-image generation/editing framework called Recaption, Plan and Generate (RPG) that harnesses the chain-of-thought reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs to enhance the compositionality of text-to-image diffusion models. RPG uses an MLLM to decompose the process of generating complex images into simpler tasks within subregions and proposes complementary regional diffusion to enable region-wise compositional generation. The approach enhances generalizat...
