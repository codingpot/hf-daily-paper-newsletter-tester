summary: The paper proposes a framework, Recaption, Plan and Generate (RPG), that harnesses the chain-of-thought reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs to enhance the compositionality of text-to-image diffusion models. It decomposes the process of generating complex images into multiple simpler generation tasks within subregions and integrates text-guided image generation and editing within the proposed RPG in a closed-loop fashion. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance, particularly i...
