summary: This paper introduces a new framework called Recaption, Plan and Generate (RPG) for text-to-image generation and editing. The approach leverages the chain-of-thought reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance the compositionality of text-to-image diffusion models. The framework uses MLLM as a global planner to decompose the process of generating complex images into multiple simpler tasks and proposes complementary regional diffusion for region-wise compositional gen...
