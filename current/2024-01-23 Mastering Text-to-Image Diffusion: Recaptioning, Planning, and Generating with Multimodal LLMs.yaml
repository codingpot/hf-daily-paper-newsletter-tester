summary: This paper proposed RPG, a text-to-image generation and editing framework harnessing the reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs. It decomposes generating complex images into simpler tasks in subregions and enables regional diffusion for compositional generation. The approach outperforms state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models while exhibiting wide compatibility with different MLLM architectures and diffusion backbones....
