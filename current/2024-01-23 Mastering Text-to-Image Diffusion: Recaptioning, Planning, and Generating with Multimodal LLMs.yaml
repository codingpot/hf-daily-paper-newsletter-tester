summary: This paper proposes a training-free text-to-image generation/edition framework called RPG that uses multimodal LLMs to improve text-to-image diffusion models for handling complex text prompts. It decomposes the image generation process into simpler tasks, enables compositional generation, and integrates text-guided image generation and editing. Experiments show RPG outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in multi-category object composition and semantic alignment....
