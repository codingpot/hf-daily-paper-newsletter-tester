summary: 'The paper proposes Motion-I2V, a framework for generating consistent and controllable videos by splitting the process into two stages: one for predicting motion, and another for enhancing video with this motion information. It offers more control over video generation than previous methods and can perform zero-shot video-to-video translation. ...'
