summary: This paper proposes SpatialVLM, a framework that trains Vision Language Models (VLMs) with internet-scale spatial reasoning data to enhance their ability in qualitative and quantitative spatial Visual Question Answering (VQA) and to unlock novel downstream applications in chain-of-thought spatial reasoning and robotics. The framework uses an automatic 3D spatial VQA data generation framework that scales up to 2 billion VQA examples on 10 million real-world images. The paper features the first in...
