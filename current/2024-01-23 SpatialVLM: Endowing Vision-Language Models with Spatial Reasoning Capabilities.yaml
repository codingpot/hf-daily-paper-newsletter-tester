summary: SpatialVLM aims to endow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with spatial reasoning capabilities by training them with internet-scale 3D spatial reasoning data. The authors develop an automatic 3D spatial VQA data generation framework that scales up to 2 billion VQA examples on 10 million real-world images. They enhance the VLM's ability in both qualitative and quantitative spatial VQA and unlock new downstream applications in robotics. The project website is <https://spatial-vlm.github.io/>....
