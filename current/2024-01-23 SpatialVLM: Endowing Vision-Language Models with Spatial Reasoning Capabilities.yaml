summary: SpatialVLM aims to endow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with spatial reasoning
  capabilities by training them with internet-scale 3D spatial reasoning data. The
  authors develop an automatic 3D spatial VQA data generation framework that scales
  up to 2 billion VQA examples on 10 million real-world images. They enhance the VLM's
  ability in both qualitative and quantitative spatial VQA and unlock new downstream
  applications in robotics. The project website is <https://spatial-vlm.github.io/>....
