summary: This paper proposes a system to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLM) with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities by training them with a new dataset of 2 billion 3D spatial VQA examples generated from 10 million real-world images. The VLM is significantly enhanced in its ability to perform both qualitative and quantitative spatial VQA, and this capability unlocks novel applications in chain-of-thought spatial reasoning and robotics....
