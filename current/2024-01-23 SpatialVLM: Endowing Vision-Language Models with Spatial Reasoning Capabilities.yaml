summary: SpatialVLM is a system for enhancing Vision-Language Models' spatial reasoning capabilities by training them with internet-scale spatial reasoning data. The system uses an automatic 3D spatial VQA data generation framework that generates 2 billion VQA examples on 10 million real-world images. The trained VLM achieves significant improvement in both qualitative and quantitative spatial VQA and enables new downstream applications in robotics....
