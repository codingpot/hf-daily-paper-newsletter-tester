summary: The paper presents SpatialVLM, a system that aims to improve the spatial reasoning capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) by training them on internet-scale spatial reasoning data. The system includes an automatic 3D spatial VQA data generation framework that generates 2 billion VQA examples on 10 million real-world images. The proposed approach significantly enhances the VLM's ability in both qualitative and quantitative spatial VQA and demonstrates its applications in downstream tasks s...
