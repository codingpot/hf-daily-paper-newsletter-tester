summary: The paper introduces a software suite called SERL that provides a carefully
  implemented library of sample efficient off-policy deep RL methods, rewards and
  reset methods, a high-quality controller for a commonly used robot, and challenging
  example tasks. The library can achieve very efficient learning, perfect success
  rates, and extreme robustness for tasks such as PCB board assembly, cable routing,
  and object relocation in less than an hour of training per policy. The code, documentation,
  and v...
