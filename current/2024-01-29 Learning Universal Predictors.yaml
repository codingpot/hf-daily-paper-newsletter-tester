summary: This paper explores the potential of using meta-learning to expose neural networks to a broad range of patterns using Universal Turing Machines (UTMs) to generate training data. The results suggest that UTM data is a valuable resource for meta-learning and can be used to train neural networks capable of learning universal prediction strategies....
