summary: This paper proposes a method called Web Rephrase Augmented Pre-training (WRAP)
  to improve the efficiency of training large language models by using off-the-shelf
  instruction-tuned models to rephrase documents in specific styles. This method speeds
  up training and improves performance on downstream tasks by incorporating style
  diversity and higher quality data....
