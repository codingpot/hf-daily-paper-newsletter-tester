summary: This paper proposes a method called Web Rephrase Augmented Pre-training (WRAP) to improve the efficiency of training large language models by using off-the-shelf instruction-tuned models to rephrase documents in specific styles. This method speeds up training and improves performance on downstream tasks by incorporating style diversity and higher quality data....
