summary: Large multimodal models demonstrate remarkable generalist ability to perform\ndiverse multimodal tasks in a zero-shot manner. Large-scale web-based\nimage-text pairs contribute fundamentally to this success, but suffer from\nexcessive noise. Recent studies use alternative captions synthesized by\ncaptioning models and have achieved notable benchmark performance. However, our\nexperiments reveal significant Scalability Deficiency and World Knowledge Loss\nissues in models trained with synthetic captions, which have been largely\nobscured by their initial benchmark success. Upon closer examination, we\nidentify the root cause as the overly-simplified language structure and lack of\nknowledge details in existing synthetic captions. To provide higher-quality and\nmore scalable multimodal pretraining data, we propose CapsFusion, an advanced\nframework that leverages large language models to consolidate and refine\ninformation from both web-based image-text pairs and synthetic captions.\nExtensive experiments show that CapsFusion captions exhibit remarkable\nall-round superiority over existing captions in terms of model performance\n(e.g., 18.8 and 18.3 improvements in CIDEr score on COCO and NoCaps), sample\nefficiency (requiring 11-16 times less computation than baselines), world\nknowledge depth, and scalability. These effectiveness, efficiency and\nscalability advantages position CapsFusion as a promising candidate for future\nscaling of LMM training.
opinion: Looks amazing!
