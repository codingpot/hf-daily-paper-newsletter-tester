summary: This paper proposes DeepSeekMoE architecture towards ultimate expert specialization in Mixture-of-Experts language models. It involves finely segmenting experts and isolating shared ones to capture common knowledge and mitigate redundancy. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepSeekMoE with 2B parameters, and show that it achieves comparable performance with larger models with less computations. They further scale up DeepSeekMoE to 16B parameters and validate its advantages over the GS...
