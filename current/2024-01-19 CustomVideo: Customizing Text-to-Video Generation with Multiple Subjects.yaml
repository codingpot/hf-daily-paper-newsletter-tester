summary: This paper proposes a novel framework for multi-subject guided text-to-video customization called CustomVideo. The framework generates identity-preserving videos with the guidance of multiple subjects, using an attention control strategy to disentangle different subjects in the latent space of a diffusion model. The model is segmented from given reference images and provided with a corresponding object mask for attention learning. The authors also collect a multi-subject text-to-video generation...
