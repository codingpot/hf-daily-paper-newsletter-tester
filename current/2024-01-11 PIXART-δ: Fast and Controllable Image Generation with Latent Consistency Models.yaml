summary: This technical report introduces PIXART-{\delta}, a text-to-image synthesis framework that integrates the Latent Consistency Model (LCM) and ControlNet into the advanced PIXART-{\alpha} model. PIXART-{\alpha} is recognized for its ability to generate high-quality images of 1024px resolution through a remarkably efficient training process. The integration of LCM in PIXART-{\delta} significantly accelerates the inference speed, enabling the production of high-quality images in just 2-4 steps. Nota...
