summary: The paper proposes TRIPS, a point-based radiance field rendering technique that combines ideas from Gaussian Splatting and ADOP. TRIPS rasterizes points into a screen-space image pyramid, allowing rendering of large points using a single trilinear write. A neural network is used to reconstruct a hole-free image, and the entire render pipeline is differentiable for automatic optimization of point sizes and positions. TRIPS outperforms existing methods in terms of rendering quality and maintains a...
