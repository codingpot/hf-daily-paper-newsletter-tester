summary: The paper presents TRIPS, an approach for real-time radiance field rendering that combines ideas from Gaussian Splatting and ADOP. It uses rasterization of points into a screen-space image pyramid and a neural network to reconstruct a hole-free image. TRIPS outperforms existing methods in terms of rendering quality with a real-time frame rate of 60 fps on available hardware....
