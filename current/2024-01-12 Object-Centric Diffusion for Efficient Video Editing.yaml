summary: This paper proposes Object-Centric Diffusion (OCD) for efficient video editing that increases speed while maintaining quality. OCD focuses computations on foreground edited regions by using Object-Centric Sampling to decouple diffusion steps and Object-Centric 3D Token Merging to reduce cross-frame attention cost. These techniques reduce memory and computational cost and are applicable to existing video editing models without retraining. Evaluated on inversion-based and control-signal-based edit...
