summary: This paper proposes Object-Centric Diffusion (OCD) for efficient video editing by reducing computational costs and allocating more resources to salient editing regions. The proposed techniques, Object-Centric Sampling and Object-Centric 3D Token Merging, can dramatically reduce memory and computational cost without retraining the video editing model. Evaluation on inversion-based and control-signal-based editing pipelines shows a latency reduction up to 10x with comparable synthesis quality....
