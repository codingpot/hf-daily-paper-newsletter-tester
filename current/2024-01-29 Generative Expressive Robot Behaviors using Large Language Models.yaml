summary: This paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) to generate expressive robot behaviors that are adaptable and composable, by translating human language instructions into parametrized control code using the robot's available skills. This approach was found to produce competent and easy-to-understand behaviors through user studies and simulation experiments....
