summary: This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate robot behaviors that are adaptable and composable, building on each other. The approach utilizes few-shot chain-of-thought prompting to translate human language instructions into control code using the robot's learned skills and exhibits behaviors that users found to be competent and easy to understand....
