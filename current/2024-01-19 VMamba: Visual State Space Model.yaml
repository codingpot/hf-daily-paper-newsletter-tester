summary: This paper presents the Visual State Space Model (VMamba), a novel architecture that leverages global receptive fields and dynamic weights, while achieving linear complexity. VMamba utilizes a Cross-Scan Module (CSM) to traverse the spatial domain and convert any non-causal visual image into ordered patch sequences, enabling it to perform well on various visual perception tasks, especially as image resolution increases....
