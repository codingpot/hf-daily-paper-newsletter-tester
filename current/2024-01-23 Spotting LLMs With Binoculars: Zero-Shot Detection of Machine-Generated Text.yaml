summary: This paper proposes a novel LLM (Large Language Model) detector called Binoculars that relies on the contrast between two pre-trained LLMs without any training data. Binoculars achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in detecting machine-generated text from a range of LLMs without any model-specific modifications, and can detect over 90% of generated samples from ChatGPT (and other LLMs) at a false positive rate of 0.01% across various document types and situations. This challenges the common belief ...
