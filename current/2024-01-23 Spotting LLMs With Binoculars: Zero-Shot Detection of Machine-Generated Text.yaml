summary: This paper proposes a novel method called Binoculars for detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) without any training data. The method is based on a score that contrasts two closely related LLMs and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in separating human-generated and machine-generated text. Binoculars is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications and is evaluated on various text sources and situations....
