summary: This paper presents a novel LLM detector called 'Binoculars' that uses a pair of pre-trained LLMs to detect machine-generated text with high accuracy. The method does not require any training data and is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications. Binoculars achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across various text sources and situations, with a detection rate of over 90% for ChatGPT and other LLMs at a false positive rate of 0.01%....
