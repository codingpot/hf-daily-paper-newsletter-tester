summary: This paper presents a novel method for detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) called Binoculars. It uses a score based on contrasting two pre-trained LLMs to separate human-generated and machine-generated text. Binoculars achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without any training data and can spot machine text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications. The method is evaluated on a number of text sources and in varied situations, detecting over 90% of gen...
