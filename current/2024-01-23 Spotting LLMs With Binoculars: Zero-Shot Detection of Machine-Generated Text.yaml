summary: This paper introduces a new method called Binoculars to detect text generated
  by large language models (LLMs). The method is highly accurate and does not require
  any training data. It can detect LLM-generated text from a range of modern models
  without any modifications and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in various situations
  and document types....
