summary: This paper introduces a novel method called Binoculars, which uses a pair
  of pre-trained LLMs to accurately detect machine-generated text without any training
  data. The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and is capable of spotting machine
  text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications. The detection
  rate is over 90% for ChatGPT and other LLMs, with a false positive rate of 0.01%.
  The paper evaluates Binoculars on a number of text sources and in varied situations...
