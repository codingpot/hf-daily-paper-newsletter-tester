summary: This paper discusses the challenges faced by reward models in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and proposes methods to address them. The proposed methods include a voting mechanism to measure the strength of preferences and new techniques to mitigate the impact of incorrect and ambiguous preferences in the dataset. The paper also introduces contrastive learning to enhance the ability of reward models to distinguish between chosen and rejected responses, and meta-learning to impr...
