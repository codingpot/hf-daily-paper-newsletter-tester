summary: This paper presents CheXagent, an instruction-tuned foundation model capable
  of interpreting chest x-rays. The model is built using CheXinstruct, a large-scale
  instruction-tuning dataset and is evaluated on CheXbench, a novel benchmark for
  CXR interpretation tasks. CheXagent outperforms previously-developed general- and
  medical-domain FMs and is fair in terms of sex, race, and age. The project can be
