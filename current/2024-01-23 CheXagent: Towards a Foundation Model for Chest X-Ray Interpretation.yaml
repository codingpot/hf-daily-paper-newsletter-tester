summary: This paper presents CheXagent, an instruction-tuned foundation model capable of analyzing and summarizing chest X-rays, addressing challenges in developing such models due to limited datasets, lack of suitable encoders, and the absence of evaluation frameworks. The model is evaluated on CheXbench, a novel benchmark designed for clinically-relevant CXR interpretation tasks. Evaluations demonstrate its superiority over previously-developed models, and fairness evaluation is also conducted to highl...
