summary: This paper introduces CheXagent, a foundation model for interpreting chest X-rays. The model is trained on a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset called CheXinstruct and evaluated on CheXbench, a benchmark for CXR interpretation. CheXagent outperforms previous general- and medical-domain FMs on the CheXbench tasks and is evaluated for fairness across demographic factors....
