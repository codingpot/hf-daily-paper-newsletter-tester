summary: This paper presents CheXagent, an instruction-tuned foundation model capable of interpreting chest x-rays. The model is built using CheXinstruct, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset and is evaluated on CheXbench, a novel benchmark for CXR interpretation tasks. CheXagent outperforms previously-developed general- and medical-domain FMs and is fair in terms of sex, race, and age. The project can be found at https://stanford-aimi.github.io/chexagent.html....
