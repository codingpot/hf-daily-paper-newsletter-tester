summary: The paper presents CheXagent, an instruction-tuned foundation model capable of analyzing and summarizing chest X-rays, addressing challenges in the development of medical image domain models due to limited dataset, lack of encoders, and evaluation framework. CheXagent outperforms previously-developed models on CheXbench, a novel benchmark for CXR interpretation tasks, and is evaluated for model transparency and fairness....
