summary: This paper introduces CheXagent, an instruction-tuned foundation model capable of analyzing and summarizing chest X-rays. The authors address challenges in developing such a model by introducing CheXinstruct, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset and CheXbench, a novel benchmark for evaluating CXR interpretation tasks. CheXagent outperforms previously-developed general- and medical-domain FMs on CheXbench tasks. Additionally, the paper performs a fairness evaluation to highlight potential per...
