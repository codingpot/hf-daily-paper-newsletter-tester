summary: The paper introduces CheXagent, a foundation model for interpreting chest x-rays, by using a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset and a clinical large language model. They also introduce CheXbench, a benchmark for evaluating the model's performance, and show that CheXagent outperforms other models. They perform a fairness evaluation to check for potential performance disparities....
