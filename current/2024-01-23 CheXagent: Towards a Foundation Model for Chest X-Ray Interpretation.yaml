summary: The paper introduces CheXagent, a foundation model for interpreting chest
  x-rays, by using a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset and a clinical large language
  model. They also introduce CheXbench, a benchmark for evaluating the model's performance,
  and show that CheXagent outperforms other models. They perform a fairness evaluation
  to check for potential performance disparities....
