summary: This research paper presents CheXagent, an instruction-tuned foundation model that can accurately interpret chest X-rays. The authors introduce CheXinstruct, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset, and CheXbench, a novel benchmark to evaluate the abilities of foundation models on CXR interpretation. They use a clinical large language model and a vision encoder to create CheXagent, which outperforms previously-developed general- and medical-domain FMs on CheXbench tasks. The authors also perfor...
