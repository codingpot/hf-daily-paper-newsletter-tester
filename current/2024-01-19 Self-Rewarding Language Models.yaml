summary: This paper proposes Self-Rewarding Language Models, in which the language model itself provides its own rewards during training, and shows that this approach improves both instruction following ability and the ability to provide high-quality rewards. Fine-tuning Llama 2 70B on three iterations of this approach yields a model that outperforms existing systems on the AlpacaEval 2.0 leaderboard, opening the door for models that can continually improve in both axes....
