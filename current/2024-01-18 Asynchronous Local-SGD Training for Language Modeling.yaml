summary: This paper examines the impact of worker hardware heterogeneity, model size, number of workers, and optimization techniques on asynchronous Local-SGD training for language models. Results show that naive implementations can take more iterations to converge, but a novel method using delayed Nesterov momentum updates and adjusting worker training steps based on computation speed matches the performance of synchronous Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step and significantly reduces wall c...
