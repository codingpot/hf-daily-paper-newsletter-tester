summary: This paper investigates asynchronous Local-SGD training for language modeling
  and finds that despite updating the global model parameters more frequently, it
  takes more iterations to converge than synchronous Local-SGD. The authors identify
  acceleration on the global parameters as a challenge when worker gradients are stale
  and propose a solution that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts
  the workers' local training steps based on their computation speed. This approach
  matches ...
