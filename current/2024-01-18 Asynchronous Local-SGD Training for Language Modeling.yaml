summary: This paper investigates asynchronous Local-SGD training for language modeling and finds that despite updating the global model parameters more frequently, it takes more iterations to converge than synchronous Local-SGD. The authors identify acceleration on the global parameters as a challenge when worker gradients are stale and propose a solution that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts the workers' local training steps based on their computation speed. This approach matches ...
