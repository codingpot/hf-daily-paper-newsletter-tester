summary: This paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models. They find that naive implementations of asynchronous Local-SGD take more iterations to converge than synchronous counterpart. They propose a novel method that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts the workers' local training steps based on their computation speed to match the performance of synchronous Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step, and significantly surpasses it in...
