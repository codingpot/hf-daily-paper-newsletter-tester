summary: This paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models. They find that with naive implementations, it takes more iterations to converge than synchronous Local-SGD, but propose a novel method that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts workers' local training steps based on their computation speed, which matched the performance of synchronous Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step and surpassed it in wall clock time....
