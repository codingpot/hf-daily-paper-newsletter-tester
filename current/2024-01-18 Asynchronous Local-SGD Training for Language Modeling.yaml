summary: This paper studies asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models and identifies challenges such as stale worker gradients and momentum acceleration on global parameters. The paper proposes a novel method that adjusts worker local training steps based on computation speed and uses a delayed Nesterov momentum update. This approach matches the performance of synchronous Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step and significantly reduces wall clock time....
