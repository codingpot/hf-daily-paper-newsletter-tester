summary: This paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models, and finds that with naive implementations, it takes more iterations to converge than synchronous Local-SGD. They propose a novel method that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts the workers' local training steps based on their computation speed, which can match the performance of synchronous Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step and surpass it in terms of wall clock time....
