summary: This paper studies asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models and investigates the impact of worker hardware, model size, and optimizer on learning performance. The authors find that naive implementations of asynchronous Local-SGD can take more iterations to converge, but propose a novel method using delayed Nesterov momentum updates and adjusting worker training steps based on computation speed which improves performance....
