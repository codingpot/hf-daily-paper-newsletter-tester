summary: This paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models. They found that without optimizations, asynchronous Local-SGD took longer to converge than synchronous training. They proposed a novel method that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts the workers' local training steps based on their computation speed, which matches the performance of synchronous Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step, and significantly improves wall clock t...
