summary: This paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD training for language modeling. It investigates the impact of hardware heterogeneity, model size, number of workers, and optimizer on learning performance. The paper identifies momentum acceleration on stale gradients as a challenge and proposes a method using a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusting workers' local training steps based on their computation speed. This approach matches the performance of synchronous Local-SG...
