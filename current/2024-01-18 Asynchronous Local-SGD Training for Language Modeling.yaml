summary: This paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models. The study examines how hardware heterogeneity, model size, number of workers, and optimizer affect learning performance. The paper proposes a novel method using a delayed Nesterov momentum update and worker-specific local training steps to address the challenge of stale gradients and improve performance....
