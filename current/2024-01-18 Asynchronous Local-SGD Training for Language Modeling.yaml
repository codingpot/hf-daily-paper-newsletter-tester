summary: This paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models. The study investigates how worker hardware heterogeneity, model size, number of workers, and optimizer impact learning performance. The results show that asynchronous Local-SGD takes more iterations to converge than synchronous Local-SGD despite updating the global model parameters more frequently. The study proposes a novel method, using delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusting workers' local tr...
