summary: This paper studies asynchronous Local-SGD, a distributed optimization approach for language modeling, and finds that it takes more iterations to converge than synchronous Local-SGD. The authors propose a novel method using delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusting workers' local training steps based on computation speed, which improves performance in terms of wall clock time and matches synchronous Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step....
