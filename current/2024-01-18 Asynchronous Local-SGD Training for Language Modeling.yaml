summary: This paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD for training
  language models. They found that without optimizations, asynchronous Local-SGD took
  longer to converge than synchronous training. They proposed a novel method that
  utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts the workers' local training
  steps based on their computation speed, which matches the performance of synchronous
  Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step, and significantly improves wall
  clock t...
