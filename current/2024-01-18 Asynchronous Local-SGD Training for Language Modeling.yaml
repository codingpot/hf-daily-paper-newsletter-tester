summary: The paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models. They find that it converges slower than synchronous Local-SGD, due to stale gradients causing momentum acceleration. They propose a method using a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusting worker training steps based on computation speed, which matches the performance of synchronous Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step and surpasses it in wall clock time....
