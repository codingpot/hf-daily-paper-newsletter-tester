summary: This paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD for training
  language models, and finds that without optimization, it takes more iterations to
  converge than the synchronous counterpart. A novel method that utilizes a delayed
  Nesterov momentum update and adjusts the workers' local training steps based on
  their computation speed is proposed, matching the performance of synchronous Local-SGD
  in terms of perplexity per update step and surpassing it in wall clock time....
