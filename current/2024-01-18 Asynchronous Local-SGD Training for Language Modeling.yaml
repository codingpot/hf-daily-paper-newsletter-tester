summary: This paper investigates the use of asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models. It finds that naive implementations take more iterations to converge than synchronous Local-SGD, but proposes a new method that matches the performance of synchronous training in terms of perplexity per update step and significantly outperforms it in terms of wall clock time....
