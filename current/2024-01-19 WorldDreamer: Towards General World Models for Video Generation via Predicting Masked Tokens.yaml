summary: WorldDreamer is a revolutionary world model that fosters a comprehensive comprehension of general world physics and motions by framing world modeling as an unsupervised visual sequence modeling challenge. Using this approach, the model predicts masked tokens by mapping visual inputs to discrete tokens and incorporates multi-modal prompts for interaction. The model excels in generating videos across different scenarios and exhibits versatility in tasks such as text-to-video conversion, image-to-v...
