summary: WorldDreamer is proposed as a world model to foster a comprehensive understanding of general world physics and motions. It frames world modeling as an unsupervised visual sequence modeling challenge by mapping visual inputs to discrete tokens and predicting the masked ones. Experiments show its effectiveness in generating videos across different scenarios, including natural scenes and driving environments, and its versatility in executing tasks such as text-to-video conversion, image-to-video sy...
