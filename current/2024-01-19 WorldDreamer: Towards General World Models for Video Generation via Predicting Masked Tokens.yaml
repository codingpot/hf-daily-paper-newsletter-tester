summary: WorldDreamer is a revolutionary world model that fosters a comprehensive
  comprehension of general world physics and motions by framing world modeling as
  an unsupervised visual sequence modeling challenge. Using this approach, the model
  predicts masked tokens by mapping visual inputs to discrete tokens and incorporates
  multi-modal prompts for interaction. The model excels in generating videos across
  different scenarios and exhibits versatility in tasks such as text-to-video conversion,
  image-to-v...
