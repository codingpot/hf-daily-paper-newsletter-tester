summary: The paper presents the Hourglass Diffusion Transformer (HDiT), a generative model that exhibits linear scaling with pixel count, enabling high-resolution training directly in pixel space. HDiT bridges the gap between the efficiency of convolutional U-Nets and the scalability of Transformers. It trains successfully without typical high-resolution training techniques, and demonstrates competitive performance on ImageNet 256^2, and sets a new state-of-the-art for diffusion models on FFHQ-1024^2....
