summary: The paper introduces the Hourglass Diffusion Transformer (HDiT), an image
  generative model that can train at high-resolution directly in pixel-space due to
  its linear scaling with pixel count. HDiT is based on the Transformer architecture
  and successfully trains without typical high-resolution training techniques such
  as multiscale architectures, latent autoencoders or self-conditioning. It achieves
  competitive performance with existing models on ImageNet 256^2 and sets a new state-of-the-art
