summary: Hourglass Diffusion Transformer (HDiT) is a generative model that allows for high-resolution image synthesis in pixel-space. It combines the Transformer architecture with the efficiency of convolutional U-Nets. HDiT successfully trains without using multiscale architectures, latent autoencoders, or self-conditioning. It competitively performs on ImageNet 256^2 and sets a state-of-the-art for diffusion models on FFHQ-1024^2....
