summary: The paper proposes a method to overcome data limitations for high-quality video diffusion models by leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. By analyzing the connection between spatial and temporal modules and distribution shift, the paper fine-tunes spatial modules with high-quality images, resulting in a generic high-quality video model with improved picture quality, motion, and concept composition. The proposed method is evaluated and found to be superior in these as...
