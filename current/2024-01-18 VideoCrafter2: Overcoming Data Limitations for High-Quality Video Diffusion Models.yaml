summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome data limitations for high-quality text-to-video generation using low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. The authors explore the training scheme of video models and finetune spatial modules with high-quality images to achieve a generic high-quality video model. Evaluations demonstrate the proposed method's superiority in picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
