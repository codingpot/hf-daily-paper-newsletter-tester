summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome the limitations of data for high-quality video diffusion models. By investigating the training scheme of video models extended from Stable Diffusion and leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images, the authors obtain a high-quality video model. The method demonstrates superiority in picture quality, motion, and concept composition, and is particularly useful for research works that train models using the low-quality WebVid-10M datase...
