summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome data limitations for high-quality video diffusion models. By leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images, the authors explore the training scheme of video models extended from Stable Diffusion and demonstrate the superiority of their method in picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
