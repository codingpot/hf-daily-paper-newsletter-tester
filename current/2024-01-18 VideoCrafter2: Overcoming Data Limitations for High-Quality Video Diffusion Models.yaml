summary: This paper proposes a training scheme for high-quality video diffusion models by leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. The study investigates the feasibility of using low-quality videos and finds that full training of spatial and temporal modules leads to better results. The proposed method finetunes spatial modules with high-quality images, resulting in a generic high-quality video model with improved picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
