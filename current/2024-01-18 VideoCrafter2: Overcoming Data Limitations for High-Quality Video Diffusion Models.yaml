summary: This paper presents VideoCrafter2, a method to overcome the limitations of large-scale, high-quality video datasets for training text-to-video generation models. VideoCrafter2 leverages low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images to generate high-quality videos, by finetuning spatial modules with high-quality images. The paper analyzes the connection between the spatial and temporal modules of video models and the distribution shift to low-quality videos and demonstrates the superiori...
