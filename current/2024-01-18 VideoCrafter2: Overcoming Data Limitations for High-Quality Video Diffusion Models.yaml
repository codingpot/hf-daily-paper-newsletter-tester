summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome the limitations of data quality in text-to-video generation models. The authors fine-tune spatial modules of the model with high-quality images and finetune temporal modules with low-quality videos, resulting in a high-quality video model that is superior in picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
