summary: This paper proposes a solution to the challenge of generating high-quality videos using text-based models. By leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images, the authors were able to train a video diffusion model that achieves better results than existing models using the WebVid-10M dataset. The authors analyzed the connection between spatial and temporal modules in video models and conducted finetuning to improve picture quality, motion, and concept composition. The proposed ...
