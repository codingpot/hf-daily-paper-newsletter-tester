summary: This paper proposes a method to train high-quality video diffusion models using low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. The authors extend the training scheme of video models from Stable Diffusion and observe that full training of all modules results in a stronger coupling between spatial and temporal modules. They finetune the spatial modules with high-quality images to shift the distribution to higher quality, resulting in a generic high-quality video model that performs better...
