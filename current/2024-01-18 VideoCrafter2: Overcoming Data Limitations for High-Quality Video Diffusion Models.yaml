summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome data limitations for high-quality video diffusion models. By exploiting low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images and finetuning spatial modules with high-quality images, the proposed method achieves a generic high-quality video model with improved picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
