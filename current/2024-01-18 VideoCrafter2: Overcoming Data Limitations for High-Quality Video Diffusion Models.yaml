summary: This paper proposes a new training scheme for video diffusion models that can generate high-quality videos using low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. The proposed method leverages the strong coupling between spatial and temporal modules in the video models and finetunes the spatial modules with high-quality images to shift the distribution to higher quality without motion degradation. The evaluation shows the superiority of the proposed method in terms of picture quality, moti...
