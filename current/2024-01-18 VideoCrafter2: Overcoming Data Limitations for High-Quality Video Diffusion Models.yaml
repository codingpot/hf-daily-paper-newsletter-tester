summary: This paper explores the feasibility of leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images to generate high-quality videos. The authors analyze the connection between spatial and temporal modules of video models and the distribution shift to low-quality videos and observe that full training of all modules results in a stronger coupling between spatial and temporal modules. They shift the distribution to higher quality without motion degradation by finetuning spatial modules with hi...
