summary: This paper proposes VideoCrafter2, a method for training high-quality video diffusion models using low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. By finetuning spatial modules with high-quality images, VideoCrafter2 shifts the distribution to higher quality without motion degradation, resulting in a generic high-quality video model. Evaluations demonstrate superiority in picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
