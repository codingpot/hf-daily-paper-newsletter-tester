summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome data limitations for high-quality video diffusion models by leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. By shifting the distribution to higher quality without motion degradation, the proposed method results in a generic high-quality video model. The paper analyzes the connection between the spatial and temporal modules of video models and the distribution shift to low-quality videos, and evaluates the superiority of the proposed met...
