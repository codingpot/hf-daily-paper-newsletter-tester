summary: This paper proposes a method to overcome the limitations of large-scale, high-quality video datasets required for training text-to-video generation models by leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. The authors analyze the connection between spatial and temporal modules in video models and conduct experiments to demonstrate the superiority of their proposed method in picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
