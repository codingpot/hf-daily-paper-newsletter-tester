summary: This research focuses on text-to-video generation, addressing the limitations of current models that rely on large-scale, high-quality videos not accessible to the community. The authors explore a training scheme extended from Stable Diffusion and investigate the feasibility of using low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images to obtain a high-quality video model. They analyze the connection between spatial and temporal modules and observe that full training results in a stronger coup...
