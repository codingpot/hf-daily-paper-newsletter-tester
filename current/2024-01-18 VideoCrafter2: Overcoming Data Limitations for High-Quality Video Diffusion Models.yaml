summary: This paper proposes a method to train high-quality video diffusion models using low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. The method involves analyzing the connection between spatial and temporal modules of video models and shifting the distribution to higher quality by finetuning spatial modules with high-quality images. The proposed method demonstrates improved picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
