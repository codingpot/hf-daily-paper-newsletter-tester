summary: The paper proposes a new method for training high-quality video diffusion models using low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images, overcoming the limitations of relying on well-filtered, high-quality videos. The method involves finetuning spatial modules with high-quality images and analyzing the connection between spatial and temporal modules to shift the distribution to higher quality. The proposed method demonstrates superiority in picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
