summary: This paper proposes a method to train high-quality video models using low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. The authors investigate the feasibility of leveraging low-quality videos and high-quality images to obtain a high-quality video model by analyzing the connection between the spatial and temporal modules of video models and the distribution shift to low-quality videos. The proposed method finetunes spatial modules with high-quality images, resulting in a generic high-quali...
