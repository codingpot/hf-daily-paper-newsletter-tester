summary: This paper proposes a new approach called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) for enhancing the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically for math problem-solving tasks. ReFT uses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations as a warmup and then employs online reinforcement learning, specifically the PPO algorithm, to fine-tune the model further. The rewards are derived from the ground-truth answers and an abundance of reasoning paths are automatically ...
