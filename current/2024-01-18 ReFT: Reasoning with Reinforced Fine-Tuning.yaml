summary: |-
    The paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to enhance the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks by employing on-line reinforcement learning, specifically the PPO algorithm. ReFT significantly outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on math problem-solving datasets and the performance can be further boosted by inference-time strategies such as majority voting and re-ranking.
