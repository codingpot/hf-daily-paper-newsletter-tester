summary: The paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) for enhancing the reasoning capability of Large Language Models by employing online reinforcement learning to further fine-tune the model. ReFT significantly outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning and can be further boosted by inference-time strategies. ReFT learns from the same training questions without relying on extra or augmented training data, indicating a superior generalization ability....
