summary: ReFT proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning for enhancing reasoning capabilities of LLMs by employing reinforcement learning to further fine-tune the model. It significantly outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning and can be further improved by inference-time strategies. This approach obtains improvement by learning from the same training questions as SFT without relying on extra or augmented training questions, which indicates a superior generalization ability....
