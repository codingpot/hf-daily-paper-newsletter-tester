summary: The paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) as an approach to enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models. Unlike supervised fine-tuning which only relies on annotated reasoning paths, ReFT employs online reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model by learning from multiple reasoning paths. Experiments show ReFT significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning and can further be boosted with inference strategies. This indicates a superior generalization ability for ReFT....
