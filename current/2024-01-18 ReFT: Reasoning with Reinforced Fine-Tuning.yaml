summary: The paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) as a method to enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by employing reinforcement learning to learn from multiple annotated reasoning paths. Experiments on math problem-solving datasets show that ReFT outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning and can be further improved with inference-time strategies. ReFT obtains improved generalization ability by learning from the same training questions as Supervised Fine-Tuning without relyin...
