summary: Authors propose a method called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to enhance the reasoning capability and generalization of Large Language Models. ReFT uses Supervised Fine-Tuning initially and then employs reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model further using multiple reasoning paths for each question. Experiments show ReFT outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning and can further improve with inference-time strategies. ReFT's improvement comes from learning from the same training questions without ...
