summary: The paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT), which utilizes reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning from multiple annotated reasoning paths, rather than relying solely on a single path as in Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on various datasets show that ReFT outperforms SFT and can further improve performance through inference-time strategies. ReFT generalizes better than SFT without relying on augmented training data....
