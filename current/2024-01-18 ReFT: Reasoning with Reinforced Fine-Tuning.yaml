summary: This paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models. ReFT uses Supervised Fine-Tuning to warm up the model, then employs online reinforcement learning to further fine-tune the model with an abundance of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments show that ReFT significantly outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning, without relying on extra or augmented training questions, demonstrating a superior generalization ability....
