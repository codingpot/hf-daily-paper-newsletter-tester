summary: This paper introduces Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) for advancing reasoning in LLMs, specifically in math problem-solving. ReFT combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Reinforced learning using the PPO algorithm, obtaining multiple reasoning paths and their rewards, without relying on extra or augmented data. By doing so, ReFT shows a superior generalization ability, outperforming SFT on GSM8K, MathQA, and SVAMP datasets, and offering potential for further improvement through inference-time s...
