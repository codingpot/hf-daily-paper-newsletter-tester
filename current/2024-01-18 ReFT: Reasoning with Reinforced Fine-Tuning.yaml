summary: ReFT is a proposed approach that uses Reinforced Fine-Tuning to enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models, particularly for math problem-solving. It addresses the lack of generalization ability by employing an on-line reinforcement learning algorithm to fine-tune the model and learn from multiple annotated reasoning paths given a question. Extensive experiments show that ReFT outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning and can be further improved with inference-time strategies. ReFT learn...
