summary: The paper proposes a method called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to improve the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). ReFT first fine-tunes the model using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then employs on-line reinforcement learning to further fine-tune the model. This approach learns from multiple annotated reasoning paths given a question instead of relying solely on the given CoT data. Experiments show that ReFT outperforms SFT and can be combined with inference-time strategie...
