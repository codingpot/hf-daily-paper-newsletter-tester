summary: This paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models by using reinforcement learning to learn from multiple reasoning paths for a question rather than relying on a single training example. This approach improves generalization ability and outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning on math problem-solving datasets....
