summary: The paper proposes a method called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by employing on-line reinforcement learning to learn from multiple reasoning paths given a question, rather than relying on annotated reasoning paths in the training data. ReFT outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on math problem-solving datasets and the performance can be further boosted by inference-time strategies. ReFT learns from the same training question...
