summary: Authors propose a method called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to enhance
  the reasoning capability and generalization of Large Language Models. ReFT uses
  Supervised Fine-Tuning initially and then employs reinforcement learning to fine-tune
  the model further using multiple reasoning paths for each question. Experiments
  show ReFT outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning and can further improve with inference-time
  strategies. ReFT's improvement comes from learning from the same training questions
  without ...
