summary: The paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by employing on-line reinforcement learning to further fine-tune the model with an abundance of automatically sampled reasoning paths and naturally derived rewards. The method shows significant improvement over Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on math problem-solving datasets and can be further improved with inference-time strategies. ReFT learns from the same training questions as SF...
