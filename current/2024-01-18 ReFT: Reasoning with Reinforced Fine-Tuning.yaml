summary: The paper proposes Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT), an approach that uses reinforcement learning to enhance the generalization ability of Large Language Models for reasoning tasks. ReFT first uses Supervised Fine-Tuning with Chain-of-Thought annotations and then employs online reinforcement learning to further fine-tune the model. Experiments on math problem-solving datasets show that ReFT outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning and can be further improved with inference-time strategies. ReFT learns fr...
