summary: This paper presents GARField, an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. It embraces group ambiguity using physical scale by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field, which allows points in the world to belong to different groups of different sizes. GARField can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via automatic tree construction or user interaction and has potential downstream applications such as 3D asse...
