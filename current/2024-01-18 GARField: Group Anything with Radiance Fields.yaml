summary: GARField is a method for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. It optimizes a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field to embrace group ambiguity and derives a hierarchy of possible groupings via automatic tree construction or user interaction. It effectively extracts groups at multiple levels and represents multi-view consistent groupings. Its hierarchical grouping has potential downstream applications such as 3D asset extraction or...
