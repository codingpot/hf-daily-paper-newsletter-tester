summary: The paper presents Group Anything with Radiance Fields (GARField) approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. By optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field, GARField effectively extracts groups at multiple levels of granularity and represents multi-view consistent groupings. The approach is evaluated on a variety of in-the-wild scenes and has potential downstream applications such as 3D asset extraction or dynamic s...
