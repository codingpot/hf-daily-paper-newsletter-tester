summary: This paper presents GARField, an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. It uses physical scale to embrace group ambiguity by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field. The field is derived from 2D masks provided by Segment Anything and can represent multi-view consistent groupings. GARField is evaluated on various scenes and is found to effectively extract groups at different levels. It has potential downstrea...
