summary: The paper presents GARField, an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field. The field can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via automatic tree construction or user interaction. GARField's hierarchical grouping has potential downstream applications such as 3D asset extraction or dynamic scene understanding, and is evaluated on a variety of in-the-wild scenes, produ...
