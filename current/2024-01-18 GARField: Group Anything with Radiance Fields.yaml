summary: This paper presents GARField, an approach to group 3D scenes into semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. It uses a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field to embrace group ambiguity through physical scale, and optimizes this field from 2D masks provided by Segment Anything. GARField can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings and produces higher fidelity groups than the input SAM masks. It has potential applications in 3D asset extraction or dynamic scene understanding....
