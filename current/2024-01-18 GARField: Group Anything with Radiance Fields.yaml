summary: GARField is an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. It uses a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field to embrace group ambiguity through physical scale and optimizes this field from a set of 2D masks provided by Segment Anything. This allows for the derivation of a hierarchy of possible groupings via automatic tree construction or user interaction. GARField evaluates on various in-the-wild scenes and effectively extrac...
