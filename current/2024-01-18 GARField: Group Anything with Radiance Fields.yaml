summary: The paper presents GARField, an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. The approach uses a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field and optimizes it from 2D masks provided by Segment Anything. It can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings and represents multi-view consistent groupings. It is evaluated on a variety of in-the-wild scenes and has potential downstream applications such as 3D asset extraction or dynamic scen...
