summary: This paper introduces GARField, an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into
  a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. It embraces
  group ambiguity through physical scale by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity
  feature field, which allows a point in the world to belong to different groups of
  different sizes. It evaluates GARField on various in-the-wild scenes and finds it
  effectively extracts groups at many levels, and has potential downstream applications
  such as...
