summary: This paper presents GARField, an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. By optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field, it embraces group ambiguity through physical scale and effectively extracts groups at many levels. GARField's hierarchical grouping could have exciting downstream applications such as 3D asset extraction or dynamic scene understanding....
