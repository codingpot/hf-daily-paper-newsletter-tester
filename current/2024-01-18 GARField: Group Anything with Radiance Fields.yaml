summary: GARField is an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. The paper presents an approach which embraces group ambiguity through physical scale by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field, a point in the world can belong to different groups of different sizes. The field can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via automatic tree construction or user interaction. The paper evaluates GARField on a variety of in-...
