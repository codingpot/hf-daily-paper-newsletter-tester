summary: The paper proposes the use of Radiance Fields to group 3D scenes into a hierarchy
  of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. By optimizing a scale-conditioned
  3D affinity feature field, a point in the world can belong to different groups of
  different sizes, allowing for flexible grouping. It can derive a hierarchy of possible
  groupings via automatic tree construction or user interaction, showing effective
  extraction of groups at various levels. The method also represents multi-vi...
