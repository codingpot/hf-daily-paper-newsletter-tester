summary: 'Grouping is inherently ambiguous due to the multiple levels of granularity in which one can decompose a scene -- should the wheels of an excavator be considered separate or part of the whole? We present Group Anything with Radiance Fields (GARField), an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. To do this we embrace group ambiguity through physical scale: by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field, a point in t...'
