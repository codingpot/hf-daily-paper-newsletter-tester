summary: GARField is an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs, embracing group ambiguity through physical scale. By optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field, GARField can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings and produces higher fidelity groups than the input SAM masks. GARField's hierarchical grouping has exciting downstream applications such as 3D asset extraction or dynamic scene understanding. See the project w...
