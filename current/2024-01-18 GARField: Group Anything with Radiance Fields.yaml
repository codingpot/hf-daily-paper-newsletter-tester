summary: GARField is an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field. It embraces group ambiguity through physical scale and effectively extracts groups at many levels. GARField's hierarchical grouping could have downstream applications such as 3D asset extraction or dynamic scene understanding. See the project website at https://www.garfield.studio/....
