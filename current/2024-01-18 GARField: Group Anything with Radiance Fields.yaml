summary: This paper introduces the Group Anything with Radiance Fields (GARField) approach for decomposing 3D scenes into semantically meaningful groups. GARField uses a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field to embrace group ambiguity and derive a hierarchy of possible groupings. The method produces higher fidelity groups than input SAM masks and has potential downstream applications, such as 3D asset extraction or dynamic scene understanding.
