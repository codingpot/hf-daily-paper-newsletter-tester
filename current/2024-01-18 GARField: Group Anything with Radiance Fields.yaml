summary: This paper presents GARField, an approach that uses physical scale to effectively decompose 3D scenes into semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. GARField optimizes a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field to derive a hierarchy of possible groupings, improving upon the input SAM masks and offering potential applications such as 3D asset extraction and dynamic scene understanding.
