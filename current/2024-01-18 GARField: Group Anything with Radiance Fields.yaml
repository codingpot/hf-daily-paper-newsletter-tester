summary: This paper presents GARField, a method for grouping 3D scenes into semantically meaningful groups using scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature fields. The approach involves optimizing the field from 2D masks provided by Segment Anything, which respects a coarse-to-fine hierarchy and uses scale to fuse conflicting masks from different viewpoints. The method produces multi-view consistent groupings and has downstream applications in 3D asset extraction and dynamic scene understanding....
