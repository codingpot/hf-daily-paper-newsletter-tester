summary: GARField is an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. By optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field, GARField embraces group ambiguity through physical scale and effectively extracts groups at multiple levels. It's evaluated on various in-the-wild scenes and provides multi-view consistent groupings with higher fidelity than the input SAM masks. The method has potential downstream applications in 3D asset extrac...
