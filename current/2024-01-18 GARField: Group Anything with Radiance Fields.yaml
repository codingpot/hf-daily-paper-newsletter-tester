summary: This paper presents GARField, an approach that decomposes 3D scenes into a hierarchical structure of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. By optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field, it embraces group ambiguity through physical scale. It evaluates GARField on a variety of scenes and finds that it effectively extracts groups at different levels. Its hierarchical grouping can have potential applications in 3D asset extraction or dynamic scene understanding. Check...
