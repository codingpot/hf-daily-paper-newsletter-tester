summary: The paper proposes a lightweight and fast diffusion-based vocoder called
  FreGrad that decomposes a waveform into sub-band wavelets using discrete wavelet
  transform, utilizes a frequency-aware dilated convolution for accurate frequency
  information, and employs various techniques to improve generation quality. FreGrad
  achieves faster training and inference speeds than the baseline, while reducing
  the model size without sacrificing output quality. Audio samples are available at
