summary: The paper proposes a lightweight and fast diffusion-based vocoder called FreGrad that decomposes a waveform into sub-band wavelets using discrete wavelet transform, utilizes a frequency-aware dilated convolution for accurate frequency information, and employs various techniques to improve generation quality. FreGrad achieves faster training and inference speeds than the baseline, while reducing the model size without sacrificing output quality. Audio samples are available at <https://mm.kaist.ac...
