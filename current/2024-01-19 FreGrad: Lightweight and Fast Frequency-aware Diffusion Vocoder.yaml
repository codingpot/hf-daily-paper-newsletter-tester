summary: FreGrad is a lightweight and fast diffusion-based vocoder that generates realistic audio. It decomposes a complex waveform into sub-band wavelets, utilizes frequency-aware dilated convolution, and employs tricks to improve quality. FreGrad is 3.7 times faster to train, 2.2 times faster to infer, and has 0.6 times the model size compared to the baseline without sacrificing quality.
