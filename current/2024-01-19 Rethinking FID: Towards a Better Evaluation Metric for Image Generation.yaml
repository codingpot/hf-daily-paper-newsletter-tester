summary: This paper critiques the use of the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) as a
  metric for evaluating image generation, highlighting its drawbacks and inconsistencies.
  It proposes a new metric, CMMD, based on CLIP embeddings and the maximum mean discrepancy
  distance with the Gaussian RBF kernel, which offers a more robust and reliable assessment
  of image quality....
