summary: This paper critiques the use of the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) as a metric for evaluating image generation, highlighting its drawbacks and inconsistencies. It proposes a new metric, CMMD, based on CLIP embeddings and the maximum mean discrepancy distance with the Gaussian RBF kernel, which offers a more robust and reliable assessment of image quality....
