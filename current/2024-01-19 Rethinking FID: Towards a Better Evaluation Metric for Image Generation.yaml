summary: This paper argues that Frechet Inception Distance (FID), a popular evaluation metric for image generation methods, has significant drawbacks. The authors highlight FID's poor representation of the content generated by modern text-to-image models, incorrect normality assumptions, and poor sample complexity. They propose a new metric, CMMD, based on CLIP embeddings and the maximum mean discrepancy distance with the Gaussian RBF kernel as a more reliable alternative. The authors demonstrate through...
