summary: This paper critiques the popular evaluation metric, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), for image generation and proposes an alternative, CMMD. FID has limitations in representing the rich content generated by modern text-to-image models, making incorrect normality assumptions, and having poor sample complexity. The paper demonstrates that FID contradicts human raters, does not capture distortion levels, and produces inconsistent results. CMMD, based on richer CLIP embeddings and maximum mean disc...
