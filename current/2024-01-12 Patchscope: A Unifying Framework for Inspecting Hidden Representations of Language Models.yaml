summary: This paper proposes Patchscopes, a framework for inspecting the hidden representations of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging the model itself to explain its internal representations in natural language. Patchscopes unifies prior interpretability methods and opens up new possibilities such as using a more capable model to explain the representations of a smaller model and self-correction in multi-hop reasoning....
