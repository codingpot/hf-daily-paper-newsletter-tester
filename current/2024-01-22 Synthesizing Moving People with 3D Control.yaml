summary: 'This paper introduces a diffusion model-based framework for animating people from a single image, based on a target 3D motion sequence. The framework consists of two components: learning priors about invisible parts of the human body and clothing, and rendering novel body poses with proper clothing and texture. The authors use an in-filling diffusion model to hallucinate unseen parts of a person, and train it on texture map space for better efficiency. A diffusion-based rendering pipeline is als...'
