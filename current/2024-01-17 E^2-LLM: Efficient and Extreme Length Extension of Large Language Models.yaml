summary: This paper proposes a method called E^2-LLM that extends the length of large language models without requiring extensive training hours and resources. E^2-LLM only requires a short length of training data and uses position embeddings and augmentation methods to make the model more robust to different context lengths. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of E^2-LLM on long-context tasks....
