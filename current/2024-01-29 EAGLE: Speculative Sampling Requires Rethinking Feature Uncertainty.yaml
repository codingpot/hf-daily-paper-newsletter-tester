summary: The paper proposes a new method called EAGLE for accelerating Large Language Model decoding. By predicting features at the second-top layer and including tokens from the next layer, EAGLE addresses the sampling uncertainty issues in next-feature prediction. This method is faster than existing frameworks like Lookahead and Medusa and provides lossless acceleration, which means the generated text has the same distribution as vanilla auto-regressive decoding....
