summary: The paper proposes a new method called EAGLE for accelerating Large Language
  Model decoding. By predicting features at the second-top layer and including tokens
  from the next layer, EAGLE addresses the sampling uncertainty issues in next-feature
  prediction. This method is faster than existing frameworks like Lookahead and Medusa
  and provides lossless acceleration, which means the generated text has the same
  distribution as vanilla auto-regressive decoding....
